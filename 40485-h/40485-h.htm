<h2>EDITOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The author of this volume, having written it from

materials, which include bushels of letters&mdash;but unwilling
to commit it to the press in the disjointed condition which
was a natural consequence of her own want of much practice
of the pen&mdash;did me the honor of requesting my aid
in revising and arranging it for publication. Her honesty
and sincerity of character have caused her to insist upon a
preface to that effect. Though deeming this a superfluous
scruple on her part, I am induced to comply with her wish
for a different reason; and that is, the opportunity it affords
of bearing my testimony to the remarkable accuracy
of her memory and of her truthfulness, as those qualities
have proved themselves throughout the intimate intercourse
of many weeks, during which she has often had to
repeat the same recollections of facts and incidents, under
what was almost legal cross-examination, without ever the
slightest variation in their details, and without ever allowing

tainted with inaccuracy or mistake. As she is so well
known to so many friends, it is superfluous for me to express
on this page, which will meet her eye for the first
time in print, the high and affectionate esteem and respect
with which that intimate intercourse, with all its opportunities
for observation and judgment, have inspired the<br />

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="l3" />

<p>It is not that the history of Spiritual Manifestations in
this century and country has not again and again been
written, nor that a library of the splendid literature of
Spiritualism&mdash;narrative, philosophical, and religious&mdash;does
not already exist, that I have deemed it a duty to give this
history to the world.</p>

<p>It happens that nobody else possesses&mdash;both in vivid personal
recollections and in stores of documentary material&mdash;the
means and the data necessary for the task of giving a
correct account of the initiation of the movement known
as Modern Spiritualism; and the now hastening lapse of
years gives warning that if to place it on record is a duty&mdash;as
many friends have often urged&mdash;it is a duty not to
be much longer delayed.</p>

<p>Many mistakes and material omissions have been made
in former summary accounts from pens of friends, as well
as misstatements from those of foes; nor could any one
heretofore form any clear or complete idea of the early
years of the epochal period which dates from March 31,
1848.</p>

<p>Since that day, starting from a small country village
of Western New York, Spiritualism has made its way&mdash;against
tremendous obstacles and resistances, but under
an impulse and a guidance from higher spheres&mdash;round
the civilized globe. Starting from three sisters, two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
them children, and the eldest a little beyond that age,
clustered round a matchless mother (whose revered portrait
does honor to my title-page), its ranks of believers,
private or publicly avowed, have grown within thirty-six
years to millions whose number no man positively knows,
but which, I think, cannot be less than as many as it counts
of years. Beginning in a small house, temporarily occupied
while another was building, it has established itself
in sovereign palaces; and the latest reports from England
represent it as fast growing, under the encouraging
influence of the reigning royal family, even into social
fashionableness. As in the story of the weary forty years&rsquo;
wandering of the children of Israel in the desert&mdash;fed
by food and led by light, both from heaven&mdash;so does
Spiritualism seem to be now nearing the borders of its
Promised Land. It is but a few years since it was a favorite
topic for scoff or sneer by the press, while now it is
but rarely that here and there is to be found some writer
so far lagging behind the march of the age as still to yield,
in that way, to the force of former foolish habit. How
far and how deeply it has modified the old teachings of
the pulpit is patent to all observant eyes; while among
the priesthood in the divine temple of Science, the number
and unsurpassed rank of those who, under its influence,
have abandoned the materialism of their old philosophies,
after exhaustive investigation of the facts and
truths of Spiritualism, is such as to stamp with the disgrace
of simple ignorance those who may still dare to deny
and deride;&mdash;even as history has fixed the fate of those
professors and priests who refused to take a look through
Galileo&rsquo;s telescope; or of those doctors who, being past
the age of forty, could never, to their dying day, accept
Harvey&rsquo;s demonstrations of the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the following pages how a vein of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
mysterious something which, in our generation of &ldquo;the
Fox family,&rdquo; has come to be called &ldquo;mediumship,&rdquo; is perceptible,
cropping out in old stories, running through ancestral
generations, and how it reappears most marvellously
in an infant in the next one succeeding to us. It will also
appear how long and strenuously we resisted its influence
and its manifestations, and struggled against the absolute
persecutions which at last forced us into publicity.</p>

<p>I conclude this Introduction by a brief allusion to the
reasonable question which has been so often asked, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui
bono?</i>&mdash;or what is the use of the manifestations of Spiritualism?</p>

<p>It is that they <em>demonstrate</em> the reality of the survival
of man&rsquo;s spirit, or inner self, after that &ldquo;death&rdquo; which is
but birth into another stage of progressed and progressive
life, in unchanged personality and identity; or, in other
words, that immortality of the soul (heretofore a mere
dogma of unproved and unprovable &ldquo;faith&rdquo;), which is
the foundation corner-stone of all religions and of all
Religion. In the words of Paul, to &ldquo;faith&rdquo; they &ldquo;add
knowledge.&rdquo; They thus not only console bereavement,
snatch from death its sting, and from the grave its victory,
but through the concurrent teachings of all good and
advanced spirits they make us feel the <em>real reality</em> of the
brotherhood of mankind, and the common fatherhood of
that supreme, unnamed, and unnamable Infinitude of
Love, Wisdom, and Power, who is addressed in Pope&rsquo;s
Universal Prayer, as&mdash;</p>

<p class="sbt">&ldquo;Mysterious Noises&rdquo; heard in the house of John D. Fox, in
Hydesville (Town of Arcadia), near Newark, Wayne
County, N.&nbsp;Y.&mdash;Statements of Witnesses.</p>


<p>The following statements were made by the different persons
whose names are signed to them, and taken down
in writing as they made them; after which they were
carefully read, and signed by them. They comprise but a
small number of those who heard these noises, or have
been knowing to these transactions; but they are deemed
sufficient to satisfy the public mind in regard to their
truthfulness.</p>


<h3>CERTIFICATE OF MRS. MARGARET FOX, WIFE OF JOHN D. FOX,
THE OCCUPANT OF THE HOUSE.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;We moved into this house on December 11, 1847, and
have resided here since that date. We formerly lived in the
city of Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y. We were first <em>disturbed</em> by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
noises about a fortnight ago. It sounded like some one
knocking in the east bedroom, on the floor; we could hardly
tell where to locate the sounds, as sometimes it sounded as
if the furniture was moved, but on examination we found
everything in order. The children had become so alarmed
that I thought best to have them sleep in the room with
us. There were four of us in family, and sometimes
five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the night of the first disturbance we all got up,
lighted a candle and searched the entire house, the noises
continuing during the time, and being heard near the same
place. Although not very loud, it produced a jar of the
bedsteads and chairs that could be felt when we were in
bed. It was a tremulous motion, more than a sudden jar.
We could feel the jar when standing on the floor. It continued
on this night until we slept. I did not sleep until
about twelve o&rsquo;clock. On March 30th we were disturbed
all night. The noises were heard in all parts of the
house. My husband stationed himself outside of the door
while I stood inside, and the knocks came on the door between
us. We heard footsteps in the pantry, and walking
down-stairs; we could not rest, and I then concluded that
the house must be haunted by some unhappy, restless
spirit. I had often heard of such things, but had never
witnessed anything of the kind that I could not account
for before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Friday night, March 31, 1848, we concluded to go
to bed early and not permit ourselves to be disturbed by
the noises, but try and get a night&rsquo;s rest. My husband
was here on all these occasions, heard the noises, and helped
search. It was very early when we went to bed on this
night; hardly dark. I had been so broken of my rest I
was almost sick. My husband had not gone to bed when
we first heard the noise on this evening. I had just lain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
down. It commenced as usual. I knew it from all
other noises I had ever before heard. The children, who
slept in the other bed in the room, heard the rapping, and
tried to make similar sounds by snapping their fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My youngest child (Cathie) said: &lsquo;Mr. Splitfoot, do as
I do,&rsquo; clapping her hands. The sound instantly followed
her with the same number of raps; when she stopped the
sound ceased for a short time. Then Margaretta said, in
sport: &lsquo;Now do just as I do; count one, two, three, four,&rsquo;
striking one hand against the other at the same time, and
the raps came as before. She was afraid to repeat them.
Then Cathie said, in her childish simplicity: &lsquo;O mother,
I know what it is; to-morrow is April-fool day, and it&rsquo;s
somebody trying to fool us.&rsquo; I then thought I could put
a test that no one in the place could answer. I asked the
noise to rap my different children&rsquo;s ages, successively. Instantly
each one of my children&rsquo;s ages was given correctly,
pausing between them sufficiently long to individualize
them until the seventh, at which a longer pause was made,
and then three more emphatic raps were given, corresponding
to the age of the little one that died, which was my
youngest child. I then asked: &lsquo;Is this a human being that
answers my questions so correctly?&rsquo; There was no rap. I
asked: &lsquo;Is it a spirit? If it is, make two raps?&rsquo; Two sounds
were given as soon as the request was made. I then said:
&lsquo;If it was an injured spirit, make two raps,&rsquo; which were
instantly made, causing the house to tremble. I asked,
&lsquo;Were you injured in this house?&rsquo; The answer was given
as before. &lsquo;Is the person living that injured you?&rsquo; Answered
by raps in the same manner. I ascertained by the
same method that it was a man, aged thirty one-years; that
he had been murdered in this house, and his remains were
buried in the cellar; that his family consisted of a wife and
five children, two sons and three daughters, all living at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the time of his death, but that his wife had since died. I
asked: &lsquo;Will you continue to rap if I call in my neighbors
that they may hear it too?&rsquo; The raps were loud in the affirmative.
My husband went and called in Mrs. Redfield (our
nearest neighbor). She is a very candid woman. The
girls were sitting up in bed clinging to each other and
trembling with terror. I think I was as calm as I am now.
Mrs. Redfield came immediately (this was about half past
seven), thinking she would have a laugh at the children;
but when she saw them pale with fright and nearly speechless,
she was amazed, and believed there was something
more serious than she had supposed. I asked a few questions
for her, and was answered as before. He told her
age exactly. She then called her husband, and the same
questions were asked and answered. Then Mr. Redfield
called in Mr. Duesler and wife, and several others. Mr.
Duesler then called in Mr. and Mrs. Hyde, also Mr. and
Mrs. Jewell. Mr. Duesler asked many questions, and received
answers. I then named all the neighbors I could
think of, and asked if any of them had injured him, and
received no answer. Mr. Duesler then asked questions
and received answers. He asked, &lsquo;Were you murdered?&rsquo;
Raps affirmative. &lsquo;Can your murderer be brought to
justice?&rsquo; No sound. &lsquo;Can he be punished by the law?&rsquo;
No answer. He then said: &lsquo;If your murderer cannot be
punished by the law, manifest it by raps,&rsquo; and the raps
were made clearly and distinctly. In the same way Mr.
Duesler ascertained that he was murdered in the east bed-room
about five years ago, and that the murder was committed
by a Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, on a Tuesday night, at twelve
o&rsquo;clock; that he was murdered by having his throat cut
with a butcher knife; that the body was taken down cellar;
that it was not buried until the next night; that it was
taken through the buttery, down the stairway, and that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was buried ten feet below the surface of the ground. It
was also ascertained that he was murdered for his money, by
raps affirmative. &lsquo;How much was it, one hundred?&rsquo; No
rap. &lsquo;Was it two hundred?&rsquo; etc.; and when he mentioned
five hundred the raps replied in the affirmative. Many
called in who were fishing in the creek, and all heard the
same questions and answers. Many remained in the house
all night. I and my children left the house. My husband
remained in the house with Mr. Redfield all night. On the
next Saturday the house was filled to overflowing. There
were no sounds heard during the day, but they commenced
again in the evening. It was said there were over three
hundred persons present at the time. On Sunday morning
the noises were heard throughout the day by all who came
to the house. On Saturday night, April 1st, they commenced
digging in the cellar; they dug until they came
to water, and then gave it up. The noise was not heard
on Sunday evening nor during the night. Stephen B.
Smith and wife (my daughter Maria), and my son, David
S. Fox and wife, slept in the room this night. I have
heard nothing since that time until yesterday. In the
forenoon of yesterday there were several questions answered
in the usual way, by rapping. I have heard the noise
several times to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a believer in haunted houses or supernatural
appearances. I am very sorry that there has been so
much excitement about it. It has been a great deal of
trouble to us. It was our misfortune to live here at this
time; but I am willing and anxious that the truth should
be known, and that a true statement should be made. I
cannot account for these noises; all that I know is, that
they have been heard repeatedly, as I have stated. I have
heard this rapping again this (Tuesday) morning, April
4th. My children also heard it. I certify that the foregoing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
statement has been read to me, and that the same
is true; and that I should be willing to take my oath that
it is so, if necessary.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF JOHN D. FOX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard the above statement of my wife, Margaret
Fox, read, and hereby certify that the same is true in all
its particulars. I heard the same rappings which she has
spoken of, in answer to the questions, as stated by her.
There have been a great many questions besides those
asked, and answered in the same way. Some have been
asked a great many times, and they have always received
the same answers. There has never been any contradiction
whatever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know of any way to account for these noises,
as being caused by any natural means. We have searched
every nook and corner in and about the house, at different
times, to ascertain if possible whether anything or anybody
was secreted there that could make the noise, and
have not been able to find anything which would or could
explain the mystery. It has caused a great deal of trouble
and anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hundreds have visited the house, so that it is impossible
for us to attend to our daily occupations; and I hope that,
whether caused by natural or supernatural means, it will
be ascertained soon. The digging in the cellar will be
resumed as soon as the water settles; and then it can be
ascertained whether there are any indications of a body
ever having been buried there; and if there are, I shall
have no doubt but that it is of supernatural origin.</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF WILLIAM DUESLER.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I live in this place. I moved from Cayuga County
here, last October. I live within a few rods of the house
in which these sounds have been heard. The first I heard
anything about them was a week ago last Friday evening
(March 31st). Mrs. Redfield came over to my house, to
get my wife to go over to Mr. Fox&rsquo;s. Mrs. R. appeared
to be very much agitated. My wife wanted me to go over
with them, and I accordingly went. When she told us
what she wanted us to go over there for, I laughed at her
and ridiculed the idea of there being anything mysterious
about it. I told her it was all nonsense, and that we
would find out the cause of the noise, and that it could
easily be accounted for. This was about nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening. There were some twelve or fourteen persons
present when I left them. Some were so frightened
that they did not want to go into the room. I went into
the room and sat down on the bed. Mr. Fox asked a
question, and I heard the rapping, which they had spoken
of, distinctly. I felt the bedstead jar when the sounds
were produced. Mr. Fox then asked if it would answer
my questions if I asked any; and it rapped three times.
I then asked if it was an injured spirit, and it rapped. I
asked if it had come to hurt any one who was then present.
It did not rap. I then reversed the question, and it
rapped. I asked if my father or I had injured it (as we
had formerly lived in that house), and there was no noise.
&lsquo;If we have not injured you, manifest it by rapping,&rsquo; and
we all heard three distinct raps. I then asked if such or
such a one had injured it (meaning the several families
who had formerly lived in the house), and there was no
noise. Upon asking the negatives of those questions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rapping was heard. I then asked if Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;(naming a
person who had lived in the house at a former period) had
injured it; and if so, to manifest it by rapping, and it
made three raps louder than usual; and at the same time
the bedstead jarred more than it had before. I then inquired
if it was murdered for money, and the sounds were
heard. Questions and answers as to different sums of
money were then given as stated by Mr. Fox. All in the
room said they heard the sounds distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that, I went over and got Artemus W. Hyde to
come over. I then asked over nearly all the same questions,
and got the same answers. Mr. Redfield went after
David Jewell and wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Hyde also came
in. After they came, I asked the same questions over
again, and got the same answers. I asked if it was murdered
by being struck on the head, and there were no
sounds; I then reversed the question, and the rapping was
heard. I then asked if it was stabbed in the side, and
there was no answer. Upon asking the negative of this
the rapping was heard. It usually rapped three times in
giving an affirmative answer to my questions. I then
asked if it had its throat cut, and it rapped as usual.
Then, if it was with a butcher knife, and the rapping was
heard. In the same way it was ascertained that it was
asleep at the time, but was awakened when the knife entered
its throat; that it struggled and made some noise
and resistance. Then I asked if there was any one in the
house at the time but him, and it did not rap. I then
asked if they two were alone, and the rapping was heard.
I then asked if Lucretia Pulver was there at the time, and
there was no rapping. If she had gone away that night,
and if Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;was gone away also, and the rapping
was heard each time. There was no rapping heard, only
when we asked questions. I then asked if any one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Hydesville knew of the murder at the time except&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;,
and it rapped. Then I asked about a number of persons,
if they knew it, and there was no rapping until I came
to Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, and when I came to her name the rapping
was heard. Then if any one but&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;and wife knew
of it, and I got no rap. Then if they were all that knew
of the murder, and it rapped. I asked if the body was
put into the cellar, and it rapped. I then asked if it was
buried in different points of the cellar, and to all my questions
there was no rapping, until I asked if it was near
the centre, and the rapping was heard. Charles Redfield
then took a candle and went down cellar. I told him to
place himself in different parts of the cellar, and as he did
so I asked the question if a person was over the place where
it was buried, and I got no answer until he stood over a
certain place in the cellar, when it rapped. He then
stepped one side, and when I asked the question there were
no noises. This we repeated several times, and we found
that whenever he stood over the one place the rapping was
heard, and when he moved away from that one place,
there was no rapping in answer.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>STATEMENT OF MISS LUCRETIA PULVER.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I lived in this house all one winter, in the family of
Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;. I worked for them a part of the time, and
a part of the time I boarded and went to school. I lived
there about three months. During the latter part of the
time I was there I heard these knockings frequently: in
the bedroom, under the foot of the bed. I heard it a number
of nights, as I slept in the bedroom nearly all the time
that I stayed there. One night I thought I heard a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
walking in the buttery. This buttery is near the bedroom,
with a stairway between the two. Miss Amelia
Losey stayed with me that night. She also heard the noise,
and we were both much frightened, and got up and fastened
down the windows, and fastened the door. It sounded
as if a person walked through the buttery, down cellar,
and part way across the cellar bottom, and then the noise
ceased. There was no one else in the house at the time
except my little brother, who was asleep in the same room
with us. This was about twelve o&rsquo;clock I should think.
We did not go to bed until after eleven, but had not been
asleep when we heard it striking. Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;
had gone to Loch Berlin, to be gone till the next day.
One morning about a week after this Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;sent me
down cellar to shut the outside door (which fastens on the
inside). In going across the cellar I sank knee deep in the
centre of the cellar. It appeared to be uneven and very
loose. After I got up-stairs Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;asked me what I
screamed for. When I told her, she laughed at me for
being frightened, and said it was only where rats had been
at work in the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A day or two after this, Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;carried a lot of dirt
into the cellar, just at night, and was at work there some
time. Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;told me that he was filling up the rat-holes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days before I first heard the noises, or anything
of the kind had ever occurred, a foot-pedlar called there
about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;then told
me that Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;thought they would not want me any
longer, and that I might go home; but, if they wanted me
again they would send for me. Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;was going to
Loch Berlin, to stay that night. This was the first I had
heard of it. I wanted to buy some things of the pedlar,
but had no money with me, and he said he would call at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
our house the next morning and sell them to me. <em>I never
saw him after that.</em> Three days after this they sent for
me to come and board with them, and go to school. I accordingly
came, and went to school about one week, when
she wanted I should stay out of school and do house-work,
as she had a couple of coats to make over for her husband.
She said they were too large for her husband, and out of
fashion, and she must alter them. They were ripped to
pieces when I first saw them. I should think the pedlar
was about thirty years old. I heard him conversing with
Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;about his family. He told her how many
children he had, in answer to her inquiry. I do not recollect
how many he said he had. Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;told me that
he (the pedlar) was an old acquaintance of theirs. A
short time after this Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;gave me a thimble, which
she said she had bought of the pedlar, and paid him fifty
cents for. Some time after I had left her I visited her
again; and she said the pedlar had been there again, and
showed me another thimble, which, she said, she had
bought of the same pedlar. She said he had cheated her;
that he had sold it to her for pure silver, but it was only
German silver. She also showed me some other things
which she said she had bought of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not (and do not now) know what to think of the
noises I have heard. The dog would sit under the bedroom
window and howl all night long. Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;
appeared to be very good folks, only they were rather
quick-tempered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This pedlar carried a trunk and a basket, I think, with
vials of essence in it. He wore a black coat and light-colored
pants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am willing to swear to the above statement, if necessary.</p>

<h3>MRS. ANNA PULVER.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I was acquainted with Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;. I called on
them frequently. My warping bars were in their chamber,
and I used to go there to do my work. One morning
when I went there Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;told me that she felt very
badly; that she had not slept much, if any, the night before.
When I asked her what the matter was, she said
she didn&rsquo;t know but it was the fidgets; but she thought
she heard something walking about from one room to
another, and that she and Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;got up and fastened
the windows down. She felt safe after that. I heard
her speak about hearing sounds after that, which she could
not account for.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;Anna Pulver.</span><br />
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;April 11, 1848.&rdquo;</span></p>


<p>It will be sufficient to sum up the important bearings of
this subject by quoting a few more extracts from the numerous
certificates contained in the little pamphlet published
by E.&nbsp;E. Lewis, Esq., of Canandaigua, N.&nbsp;Y.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Weekman lived in this house for a year
and a half, and were frequently startled by the rappings,
walking, etc. On several occasions they sought diligently
to discover the cause. He stood with his hand on the
latch, and when the knockings were repeated, suddenly
opened the door and ran into the yard and entirely around
the house; but nothing was ascertained by him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Weekman says: &ldquo;We heard great noises during the
night; sometimes a sound as if a person was walking in
the cellar. (There was nothing but a single board floor,
between the cellar and the upper room, so that the sound
made in one was easily heard in the other.) One night
one of our little girls, who slept in the room where the noises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
were heard, awoke us all by her screaming very loudly.
My husband and myself, and our hired girl, all went to the
room to see what was the matter with her. The child sat
up in bed, crying and screaming, and it was some time before
we could quiet her enough to get answers to our questions.
She said &lsquo;something had been moving around her
and over her head and face: that it was cold, and that she
felt it all over her.&rsquo; This was between twelve and one
o&rsquo;clock. We took her into bed with us, and it was a long
time before we could get her to sleep in that bed again.
At one time Mr. Weekman heard his name called. (I was
away that night, sitting up with a sick person.) He was
awakened, and supposed some one wanted him. He sat up
in bed for some time, but heard no more. We never found
out what or who called him. So many have heard these
noises that it seems there must be something unusual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jane C. Lape &ldquo;lived in the family of Mrs. Weekman
at the time she states. There was but one door in
the bedroom. When I was doing my work, I saw a man
in the bedroom joining the kitchen. I saw the man distinctly.
I was frightened. I had been in the kitchen a
long time, and knew that nobody could have gone into
that room. The man stood facing me when I saw him.
He did not speak, nor did I hear any noise at any time.
He had on light pants, black frock-coat, and cloth cap. He
was of medium size. I knew of no person in that vicinity
who would answer that description. Mrs. Weekman
was in another part of the house at that time. I left the
room, and when I returned with Mrs. Weekman there
was no person there. She thought it was some person
who wanted to frighten me; but we were never able to
ascertain who or what it was. I have always thought and
still do think that it was supernatural. I had never been
a believer in such things until I saw this.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WELL OFFENSIVE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, do hereby certify that during the
summer of 1844, we lived near the house now occupied by
John D. Fox; that it was then occupied by&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;;
and that, during the summer, the water in that well was
very offensive and bad. We further certify that said well
is within thirty feet of the centre of the cellar under said
house.</p>

<p>In my brother&rsquo;s statement (see pamphlet by E.&nbsp;E. Lewis,
Esq.) was given a correct account of the digging to find
the body of the murdered man in the cellar.</p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF DAVID S. FOX.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I live about two miles from the house my father, John
D. Fox, now occupies, and where these strange noises were
heard. It was a week ago last Friday, March 31st, when
they told me about it. I advised them to make a thorough
search, and I thought they would find a cause for it.
I heard no noise, and after remaining a short time, returned
home. The next morning, April 1, 1848, they
sent for me to come again, and they told me the noises
had been heard all night. I went early in the evening;
heard the rapping distinctly. Many questions were asked
and answered by the rapping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(It is not necessary to here repeat all of David&rsquo;s statement,
as the entire substance of it is given in nearly all
the other certificates.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large collection of people had assembled, more than
could get into the house; committees were chosen, and
placed in different parts of the house, that no deception
might be practised by any one. These committees were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
composed of neighbors and friends, whom we knew to be
strictly honest. I remained in the house until about one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The noises had ceased a little before
twelve. After some of the crowd had left, we commenced
digging in the cellar. Before digging I asked the
question: &lsquo;In what part of the cellar was your body buried?&rsquo;
naming the different corners of the cellar. No response
was made. &lsquo;Was it in the centre?&rsquo; The rapping
answered affirmatively. Mr. Carlos Hyde went down in
the cellar, walked over the bottom, asking at every point
if he was over the right place, but no rappings were heard
until he stood in the centre of the cellar. It then rapped
so that those in the cellar as well as those in the
room above could hear it. We dug about three feet
deep, when the water came in so fast we had to stop. I
was here again on Monday, April 3d, and we commenced
digging again in the cellar, and baling out the water; but
we found it impossible to make any headway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday evening they began digging again. I got
a pump, and we took up the floor and put it in the hole,
and began to pump and bale out the water at the same
time. We could not lower the water much and had to
give it up. The water is in the hole, although it is lowering
gradually. I thought, from there being so many respectable
people present, and they having heard the same
sounds that I did, that there must be something in it. I
never believed in haunted houses or anything of that kind.
I have heard of such things, but never saw or heard anything
but what I could account for on reasonable grounds.
I cannot account for this noise as being produced by any
human agency. I am perfectly willing to take my oath as
to the truth of the statements which I have here made, if
it is thought necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">HYDESVILLE (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">The Last Digging in the Cellar&mdash;Mob Antagonism&mdash;Noble
Friends&mdash;Experiences and Theories&mdash;Antecedents of the
House&mdash;Franklin.</p>


<p>It was late in July, 1848. The old house at Hydesville
was not occupied by any one, save the &ldquo;murdered man.&rdquo;
Many went there alone, or in small parties; and often the
rappings were heard.</p>

<p>We, too, visited the old house, went down into the cellar,
and called on the spirits to answer our questions and
direct us aright.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the bitter conflicts we had passed
through in Rochester, we had come to the conclusion that
good spirits (as well as bad ones) could manifest themselves
to us. We were greatly favored in our early associations
with a class of progressive philanthropic people among
our neighbors, whose highest aim was to benefit the
world, and who urged us to go forth and do our duty.
We learned from them to take a more liberal view, as
they had taught us many valuable lessons of forbearance
and perseverance. When I saw my dear good brother
bow with the others, and ask questions of the Spirits, my
soul and all within me was lifted beyond the scoffs and
ridicule which I knew we must submit to if we performed
the heavy duties incumbent upon us. There had been
great excitement for a time, but little now was said in
that vicinity about it, as there had been so much ridicule
attached to the occurrences of the past, that the leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
shrank from further publicity. But, during this time, we
were having our experiences in Rochester, where I resided.</p>

<p>It was now directed by the Spirits that the digging should
be resumed. (It was the dry season of the year, and the
water in the Ganargua<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was low.) My brother declared
that he could not again enter upon so hazardous an undertaking.
He believed himself capable of acting on his
own judgment in the matter. But for once he found, to
his utter discomfiture, that the mighty powers that seemed
to rule our destiny were not to be defeated. The Spirits
directed that he should invite certain gentlemen to assist
in the digging. They spelled out the names of many
Rochester friends, viz., Henry Bush, Lyman Granger, Mr.
Post, Dr. Faulkner, and Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Jervis. The above-named
were old and tried friends, and we felt no hesitation
in calling upon them; but when David was requested
to invite gentlemen living in the vicinity of Hydesville,
with whom he had little or no acquaintance, he positively
refused to do their bidding. The friends in Rochester
received this announcement with apparent satisfaction.
All came at the appointed time. Mr. and Mrs. Granger
and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Jervis, Dr. Faulkner
and his little son, etc. I doubt if either of these
gentlemen had ever used the pickaxe and spade before;
but they came willing to perform their duty. Brother
David still declared that he could not, and would not, make
himself so ridiculous as to invite men who would laugh at
him for entertaining such an idea; but still the Spirits commanded
him to obey instructions, and nightly they would
go through the performance of representing the murder
scene. (This occurrence was in my brother&rsquo;s house.)
Gurgling, strangling, sawing, planing, and boring; representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the enactment of the horrid crime said to have
been committed in the Hydesville house.</p>

<p>Our friends urged David to act in accordance with the
request of the &ldquo;Spirits,&rdquo; but he could not make up his
mind to do so. He walked from room to room, and in
secret prayed that this terrible injunction might be removed.
He cried, with uplifted hands, to God, to have
compassion on our family; and then, in despair, would
say: &ldquo;Better to die together, than to live so disgraced.&rdquo;
The sight of his grief and despair was heart-rending; but
the Spirits were inexorable. The day appointed for the
digging arrived. During the previous, night all was in an
uproar. The sounds as of broken crockery were heard, and
as if heavy weights were dragged across the floor. Sawing,
planing, digging, boring, groaning, and whispering
close to our ears. This continued until the bright, beautiful
dawn of the morning warned us that it was time to
prepare for the labors of the day. We were commanded
by the Spirits thus&mdash;&ldquo;Go forth and do your duty, and
good will come of it.&rdquo; Chauncy Culver, my brother&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s brother, called in, and David said: &ldquo;Chauncy, you
are politely invited to join us in the digging to-day.&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;I am willing to do so, Dave.&rdquo; Others who
had been named, but not invited, dropped in by chance,
and all united with us; but the great burden fell upon
David&rsquo;s shoulders. Chickens were cooked, puddings, pies,
cakes, and sweet-meats were prepared by my brother&rsquo;s
wife, Elizabeth, and my sister Maria. Our living was
sumptuous, and we had very little opposition during the
first day&rsquo;s work. The earth was hard and dry, and the
digging tiresome; but the party worked diligently until
near noon, when they came to a quantity of charcoal and
traces of lime (this was between four and five feet below
the cellar bottom), some hair of a reddish or sandy hue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and some teeth, which showed, beyond all question, that
the earth had at some time, and for some purpose, been
disturbed. The party worked on until it began to grow
dark, and the first day&rsquo;s work was ended. We returned
to David&rsquo;s home, about two miles from the Hydesville
house, well satisfied with our day&rsquo;s work, and the friends
felt that they had done all in their power to get at the
truth of the Spirits&rsquo; declaration.</p>

<p>We made two large beds on opposite sides of the parlor;
the women and children rested upon one of them, and
the men on the other; Dr. Faulkner and his little son
being in the parlor bedroom. All heard the manifestations
that night; and they were most wonderful in
character. This arrangement of the beds was directed by
the Spirits, that they might gratify all by making manifestations
during the night.</p>

<p>The next day we resumed our labor. The ladies accompanied
their husbands and friends. We had started as
early as possible. Mr. S.&nbsp;B. Smith, my sisters husband,
my brother David, and some of the neighbors turned out
five or six wagons to convey us to our destination, forming
quite a procession of our own; but as we came to the
turn of the hill, from whence we could see in all directions,
there were vehicles of every description wending
their way to the &ldquo;haunted house.&rdquo; Shouts of ribaldry
and roars of laughter fell upon our ears like the death-knell
of some poor soul&mdash;who might almost begin to feel himself
guilty of crimes he had never committed.</p>

<p>We entered the cellar. On came the noisy rabble. Our
noble, pale-faced, honorable men stood firm in their duty.
Mark the contrast, dear readers: many of those noble souls
now stand in the higher ranks in glory. They have passed
through the fiery furnace, entered the &ldquo;golden gate&rdquo; of
the new Jerusalem; and to them offer your praises and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
admiration. Such men and women as those dared to stand
before the world and battle for the right. It was <em>such as
they</em> who fought and won the great battle against slavery
and contributed to its overthrow. May they continue to
live in the memories of the children of earth.</p>

<p>Through the second day the digging was frequently
interrupted by the rude entrance of some of the outside
crowd. We (the women) formed a guard around the
place where the work was in progress, to protect the men
thus engaged. We had candles in our hands, with which
to light the laborers, when suddenly one of the workers
cried out, &ldquo;Great God! here are the pieces of a broken
bowl!&rdquo; (The Spirit always said that the bowl which
caught his blood was buried; and he represented nightly
the sound of pouring blood into a vessel or bowl, dropping
slower and slower, until at last it ceased entirely; and then
the sound would come as if the bowl were thrown and
broken in pieces.) Several bones were found which doctors
pronounced human bones, stating to what parts of the
body they belonged. One, I remember, was said to be
from the ankle, two from the hands, and some from the
skull, etc. (Some persons, who never saw these bones,
argued that they were not human bones, hair, and teeth
which were there found. But I ask, in the name of common
sense, how did they happen to be there, nearly six
feet beneath the cellar bottom?)</p>

<p>In the afternoon the crowd outside grew more bold, and
among them were sympathizers with the man who was accused
by the general public opinion. We pitied him, and
regretted that he had been named; but we never knew
that such a man had lived, until the neighbors had brought
out the fact by putting questions which were answered by
the rappings.</p>

<p>These spectators were becoming more and more excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and crowded into the cellar. Some called us crazy. They
reached over the heads of the women and spat upon and
dropped sticks and stones on those who were digging.
We still stood firm in the defence of our friends, the laboring
party; and they worked on until they struck what
seemed to be a board. This sounded hollow, and its location
was beneath the sand and gravel. They procured an
augur and bored through the obstruction, when the augur
dropped to the handle. They then obtained bits, and attached
them to long sticks, and with them bored several
inches, when the bit would drop to the depth of a foot or
more. In this way they lost two of the bits, which
dropped through and were not recovered. By this time
the excitement was overwhelming. The cellar was filled
with people. Some cried, &ldquo;Drag out the women! drag
them out!&rdquo; Others said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt the women, drag
out the men!&rdquo; The floor over our heads creaked with
the weight of the multitude. It grew dark. Our friends
could work no longer, and reluctantly retired. How we
all reached the outside, amid the shouts and the roar of
the excited crowd, I cannot explain; but at length we
stood together in the door-yard, awaiting our conveyances,
and no word of disrespect was spoken to any of us. The
Spirits said: &ldquo;Dear faithful friends, your work here is
done. God will reward you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said that noble-looking man, Henry Bush, with
the acquiescence of all, &ldquo;our work is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all returned to David&rsquo;s (the old homestead). That
night and the following day our friends returned to Rochester.
We remained a few days with our family.</p>

<p>I must pass over many interesting circumstances, or it
will be wholly impossible to put our story in one volume:
but I deem it due to my family that some facts should be
stated in this history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>After the public parts we had been forced to perform
at Hydesville, the news spread far and wide. The crowd
of people came in wagons from every direction before the
harvest had been gathered. Some drove through the gate,
but others took down the fences, and drove through the
grain fields, and peppermint beds, regardless of the destruction
they were perpetrating. Against all this destruction
of his property, David was defenceless. He saw and felt
how utterly useless it was for him to attempt to remonstrate
with such an element.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when a tired horseman came
galloping up the carriage road, to inform my brother that
a party consisting of several wagon-loads were on their
way to mob us. At this announcement we were much
frightened, and knew not what to do. Intimations of such
a design had reached us previously, and powder and shot
had been provided for our defence. The boys and hired
men had gathered piles of stones behind the house, and at
first it was considered to be our wisest way to defend ourselves
as best we could.</p>

<p>The sun was low and we dreaded the night coming on.
What could we do? Mother called us all into the parlor
bedroom, and there we knelt, with fear, and prayed to
God for protection. The Spirits spelled out to us, &ldquo;You
will not be harmed. God will protect you.&rdquo; We stood
for a moment and counselled together. The package of
powder flew from the top of the bureau and hit Cathie on
the forehead, and that of the shot came and struck me on
the shoulder. My brother took the guns and fired them
off, and threw the powder and shot into the peppermint
patch, saying, &ldquo;I will not raise a hand against them. If
God has sent this upon us, for the good of mankind, he is
able to protect us. I will trust him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The windows were fastened down as best we could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The dog began to bark fearfully. We heard the distant
shouts and snatches of songs, and knew they would soon
be upon us. They drove up the road, into the yard, and
one woman jumped through the window of the kitchen,
<em>hoops and all</em>. She was in the kitchen before any of us
knew they had entered the door-yard. David left us
alone in the parlor, walked into the kitchen, and said to
the woman, &ldquo;If you had knocked I would have opened
the door for you; it was not locked.&rdquo; He then opened
all the doors, walked out to the crowd, and said, &ldquo;Ladies
and gentlemen, walk in. You are welcome to search the
house from garret to cellar, if you will do so respectfully.&rdquo;
One man, the leader of the crowd, exclaimed, in
a manner of the utmost surprise: &ldquo;My God! Dave Fox,
is it you they have said so much about? No, we won&rsquo;t
come in now. We&rsquo;ll go home and dress ourselves and
come another time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus ended this mob against the Spiritualists, as all
others subsequently have ended. The Spirits, therefore,
fulfilled their promise and protected us from all harm.</p>

<p>I might fill many a page with the experiences of the
family in that house at Hydesville, during the period of
about three months and three weeks preceding that March
31, 1848, on which the neighbors were first called in.
From the very first night of their taking possession of it,
they were disturbed and puzzled with the strange knockings
and other noises. They had gone into it only as a
temporary home, while my father was building the new
house on the homestead farm, and the carpenter had estimated
a couple of months as sufficient time for his work.
All sorts of natural theories were imagined as to the cause
of the sounds, nor did they, for some time, think of Spirits
or of anything supernatural, or even important. Father insisted,
at one time, that they proceeded from a cobbler in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the neighborhood, hammering leather, and working late
in the night. Then it was &ldquo;some boards that must be
loose and shaken by the wind.&rdquo; Then it appeared that
&ldquo;there must be dancing going on at Mr. Duesler&rsquo;s, or
some other house within hearing;&rdquo; then &ldquo;the house must
be full of rats&rdquo;&mdash;though mother declared she had never
seen a rat in it. Again, when the knocks would break
out suddenly, close to some of the family, or at the table,
one of the girls would charge the other with having
caused them, saying, &ldquo;Now you did that,&rdquo; etc., etc. Father
had always been a regular Methodist, in good standing,
and was invariable in his practice of morning prayers; and
when he would be kneeling upon his chair, it would sometimes
amuse the children to see him open wide his eyes,
as knocks would sound and vibrate on his chair itself.
He expressed it graphically to mother: &ldquo;When I am
done praying, that jigging stops.&rdquo; My daughter Lizzie
used to declare that when she was writing, there would
sometimes come a strong ticking on the paper. One
night loud screams were heard from the children, Maggie
and Cathie, in bed. &ldquo;O mother, come quick. Somebody
has lain down across the bed.&rdquo; They were often so
frightened that mother would have to take them to lie
on both sides of her in her bed, and sometimes they
would go, one to father&rsquo;s bed and the other to mother&rsquo;s.
But these frights were attributed to bad dreams. Indeed,
it now seems strange that so little serious impression was
made on their minds for so long a time by these strange
things, so persistent, so varied, and so inexplicable, which
they instinctively abstained from talking about to the
neighbors.</p>

<p>It was not till March 31st that they seemed to have
culminated to the point which exhausted their patience,
and which at last drove them to do so. On the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
night they had been kept awake nearly all night by the
knocking and heavy poundings about the house; and up
to three o&rsquo;clock in the morning they were occupied pursuing
the sounds about from place to place, puzzling over
them, and baffled in every attempt to discover a cause.
The door would be pounded upon from the outside, and
father would take hold of the handle, and on the return of
the knocking would suddenly fling the door open, only to
discover nothing. He and mother stood on the opposite
sides of it, and each would hear the knocking on the side
opposite to themselves, as though made by powerful muffled
knuckles. Yet on neither side could be found traces
of any person or thing to have produced them, while both
would <em>feel</em> the strong vibrations of the wooden door.</p>

<p>It was afterward learned that, for several years back,
strange noises had been heard by successive occupants of
that house, none of whom had remained long as its tenants.
Prior to its occupation by a certain family there had
been no such disturbances; subsequently to then, they
had been experienced by all their successors. It would
be easy for me to name families of the highest respectability,
and who are still my good friends, who would attest
this.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The old Indian name of the creek.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It would seem that none of the families who, in the course of several
years, had preceded the Fox family in the occupancy of this haunted
house, combined the highly mediumistic nature with the other characteristics
specially qualifying them for the great work for which the time
was ripe, so that the manifestations, which appealed for attention, had
knocked in vain at doors which could not open to them. Dr. Franklin,
great philosopher and inventor of his time, was also, in the Spirit life,
one of the inventors of this mode of communication between the two
worlds, through knockings given in correspondence with the letters of
the alphabet. Through another medium, besides the author of this
volume, he has told me that out of &ldquo;millions&rdquo; he at last found in the Fox
family the instruments he wanted for its practical application and introduction.
This narrative curiously shows how hard and long they too
struggled against the mission to which the Spirits were leading and at
last forcing them, as will be seen below. I asked him if Spirits had influenced
them to take the Hydesville house. His reply was a curious
one. Instead of three consecutive and decided raps, which would have
expressed assent, he on two occasions answered with only two raps, followed
after a moment&rsquo;s pause with a third, completing a qualified
affirmative. &ldquo;You mean that it was partially so?&rdquo; I said; which was
immediately answered with an unqualified assent; and he added, &ldquo;It
was many, not one alone,&rdquo; thus disclaiming the credit of its sole and
individual authorship.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<br />
<span class="f8">ROCHESTER</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">My First Knowledge of the Matter&mdash;Hasten to Hydesville&mdash;Rapping
on a Canal Boat&mdash;Experiences&mdash;Mother Comes
to Rochester&mdash;Calvin Brown&mdash;Devious Route of Projectiles
Up-stairs from Cellar to Garret&mdash;A Death-knell
Sounded All Night on the Keys of a Locked Piano.</p>


<p>This volume is not meant to be an autobiography, though
I regret to be compelled to speak so much of myself in
giving an account of the inauguration of the movement
known as &ldquo;Modern Spiritualism,&rdquo; through the three sisters
of the Fox family, of whom I was the eldest, and
already married when my two sisters, Margaretta and
Catharine, were children. I was not with the family, but
at my own house in Rochester, during most of the events
related above.</p>

<p>I was myself also at that time but little more than a
child, for when I was married at Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y., I could
count but fourteen years and five months. It will be seen
below how I was twice widowed before the age of twenty-four,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
though my second marriage was on the supposed
death-bed of one who had been a brother to us all from
childhood, and who merely desired to bequeath me his
name.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish discovered when too late that he had married
a child, and soon became indifferent to his home and
family. He left Rochester under a pretence of going on
business to the West. The next I heard of him was that
he had married a rich widow in the State of Illinois.</p>

<p>As he had left little means for the support of myself and
child, I turned my attention to teaching music. I had
many friends who assisted me in getting pupils, and I was
delighted to find myself entirely independent. One day
(early in May, 1848), I was at the house of Mr. Little,
enjoying myself with the young ladies, when Mrs. Little
came in with the proof-sheet of a pamphlet issued by E.
E. Lewis, Esq., of Canandaigua, N.&nbsp;Y. Mrs. Little knew
my maiden name was Fox; that my parents (at the time)
were in Arcadia, Wayne County, N.&nbsp;Y., and concluded I
must be the daughter of John D. Fox. She then introduced
the printer, and he commenced questioning me about
my family relations. He said, &ldquo;Is your mother&rsquo;s name
Margaret? Have you a brother David?&rdquo; I replied, yes.
I began to be startled by his questions, and said, &ldquo;For
mercy&rsquo;s sake, what has happened?&rdquo; He answered by placing
the proof-sheet in my hands, which gave me the first
idea I ever had of the manifestations which had been taking
place at the dwelling of our family in Hydesville. I
read it, and cried over it. I knew not what to think, but
I said to them all, &ldquo;If my father, mother, and brother David
have certified to such a statement, <em>it is true</em>.&rdquo; All who
heard me thus declare believed it, and never wavered for
a moment. As soon as I could collect my thoughts, I called
on Mrs. Granger and Mrs. Grover, old friends of mine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of our family, and related to them the account which I had
read in the proof-sheet.</p>

<p>I told them I should take the night boat for Newark,
Wayne County. I would visit my family, and learn for
myself about the mysterious affair. They concluded to go
with me. We were, at that time, obliged to travel by the
Erie Canal packet-boat, as the direct railroad between
Syracuse and Rochester had not yet been built. It took
a few hours longer then than now to make that journey.
When we arrived at Hydesville, which is about two
miles from our old homestead, we found the house deserted.
My brother had persuaded the family to leave
the old &ldquo;haunted house,&rdquo; and live with him until their
new house was finished.</p>

<p>We drove to brother David&rsquo;s, where we found mother
completely broken down by the recent events. She never
smiled; but her sighs and tears were heart-rending. We
begged her to hope for the best, and try to think differently;
but she could not. She wished we could all die;
and it was, at the time, impossible to cheer her by anything
we could say or do. She was only about middle
age, and her health had always been good; and she was,
by nature, very cheerful.</p>

<p>I with the ladies who accompanied me remained about
two weeks, when we concluded to take Katie and Lizzie
(my daughter) with us and return home to Rochester, as
mother thought the former to be the one followed mostly
by the sounds; and we hoped, by separating the two children
(Maggie and Katie), that we could put a stop to the
disturbance.</p>

<p>We had not gone many miles on the canal, however,
when we became aware that the rapping had accompanied
us. Perfect consternation came upon us. I knew not
what to do. We did not wish our friends to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the rapping had followed us; and we remained, as much
as possible, by ourselves.</p>

<p>When we went to the dinner-table with the other
passengers, the Spirits became quite bold and rapped
loudly; and occasionally one end of the table would jump
up and nearly spill the water out of our glasses; but there
was so much noise on the boat going through the locks
and other disturbances, that only we, who recognized the
special sounds, knew of them. We arrived at home about
5 <span class="lower">P.M.</span> I sat down to think over the occurrences of the
day and of other days during my visit.</p>

<p>The two girls had gone into the garden. All at once
came a dreadful sound, as if a pail of bonnyclabber had
been poured from the ceiling and fallen upon the floor
near the window. The sound was horrible enough, but,
in addition, came the jarring of the windows and of the
whole house, as if a heavy piece of artillery had been discharged
in the immediate vicinity. I was so paralyzed by
fear that I could not move, and sat stupefied; again came
the same terrible sound, with all the jarring, as at first;
and yet again it came; when I sprang from the sofa on
which I had been seated and rushed out into the garden
where the children were. They immediately cried out,
&ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you, Leah? how pale you
look!&rdquo; I made some evasive reply, as I did not wish to
alarm them.</p>

<p>We went to bed at an early hour, being tired and much
excited. The children had expressed great fear, and I
went to bed with them. No sooner had I extinguished
the light, than the children screamed, and Lizzie said she
felt a cold hand passing over her face, and another over
her shoulder down her back. She screamed fearfully,
and I feared she would go into spasms. Katie was also
much frightened. For my part I was equally terror-stricken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I arose from my bed and sought the Bible, from
which I read a chapter. But while I was reading the
girls felt some touches. I had never felt them; and I
could not realize that they were not in some way mistaken.</p>

<p>It was now late in the night and all was silent. We
thought we would try to sleep, as we were tired and excited.
But the instant we extinguished our light the Bible
flew from under my pillow&mdash;where I had placed it, supposing
that the sacred volume would be respected. The
box of matches was shaken in our faces, and such a variety
of performances ensued that we gave up in despair to our
fate, whatever it might be. We called on each other, if
either was silent a few moments, that we might know that
we were all alive. Finally, when the night was nearly
spent, the disturbance ceased, and we fell asleep. We did
not awake until very late in the morning. The sun shone
brightly, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees of the
public square. (Our residence then was on Mechanics&rsquo;
Square.) The June roses were just out, and all nature
was in her loveliest hues. We could not make the disturbances
of the past night seem real to us. I doubted
everything, but kept my own counsel; and as the shades
of evening fell upon the scene, which had been a day of
such brightness and beauty, I made up my mind that I
would go on as usual and try to forget, as far as possible,
the frightful occurrences of the previous night. In the
evening my friend Jane Little and two or three other
friends called in to spend an hour or so with us. We sang,
and I played on the piano; but even then, while the lamp
was burning brightly, I felt the deep throbbing of the
dull accompaniment of the invisibles, keeping time to the
music as I played; but I did not wish to have my visitors
know it, and the Spirits seemed kind enough not to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
themselves heard so that others would observe what was
so apparent to me.</p>

<p>All seemed quiet when we retired for the night, at about
ten o&rsquo;clock. We slept quietly for about two hours, when
we were awakened by the most frightful manifestations.
The house was in a perfect uproar. Tables and everything
in the room below us were being moved about. Doors
were opened and shut, making the greatest possible noises.
<em>They then walked up-stairs</em> and into the room next to us
(our bedroom was an open recess off from this room).
There seemed to be many actors engaged in the performance,
and a large audience in attendance.</p>

<p>The representation of a pantomime performance was
perfect.</p>

<p>After the first scene, there was great applause by the
Spirit audience. Immediately following, one Spirit was
heard to dance <em>as if with clogs</em>, which continued fully ten
minutes. This amused the audience very much; and a
loud clapping of hands followed. After this we heard
nothing more except the representation of a large crowd
walking away down-stairs, through the rooms, closing the
doors heavily after them. It is useless to attempt to record
all the manifestations which occurred nightly during the
last few weeks that we remained in that house. I came
to the conclusion that it was haunted, and decided to move
out of it as soon as I could find another house that suited me.</p>

<p>There was a house on Prospect Street, nearly finished,
and I engaged it. I was particular to tell the agent that I
wanted a house in which no crime had been committed.
For I believed that the house I was then living in, like
the one at Hydesville, was haunted; and I presumed that
in this case as in the other it must have had its origin
in hidden crime. He smiled as he remarked that he
&ldquo;thought that I would have no difficulty on that account.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
We moved into this house as soon as possible, and congratulated
ourselves on our good fortune in finding a place
that had never before been tenanted.</p>

<p>Two houses stood on one foundation. On the ground
floor was a kitchen, cellar, and pantry. The staircase led
from the kitchen to the second floor. On the outside, a
front and rear flight of steps led to a balcony from which
we could enter the parlor and dining-room, on the second
floor. Another flight of steps led from the dining-room
to the third floor, which was one room the entire length
and breadth of the house. In this last-named room we put
up three beds, and one bed in the room on the parlor
floor. I partitioned off a small room in one corner of the
upper floor with chintz curtains. This lessened the size
of the large room and afforded us a store-room. In the
rear of the house was an old cemetery, called &ldquo;the Buffalo
Burying-ground.&rdquo; This cemetery was separated from
our lot by a high fence. I remember I disliked the idea
of seeing those tall monuments every time I went into the
pantry. (The entrance into the dining-room from the
kitchen was through the pantry.)</p>

<p>Nothing occurred, during the first night of our occupancy
of this house, of an unusual character, and we slept
undisturbed.</p>

<p>I had written to our family at Arcadia, and told them
what was transpiring with us nightly. This worried
mother, and she determined to come immediately, and
find some plan for suppressing it, if it could possibly be
done. She, with Margaretta, arrived the next day, and
we rejoiced to tell her that we had occupied the new
house one night, and no sounds had been heard to disturb
us. After supper we remained at the table a long time,
until mother suggested that it was getting late, and we had
better retire for the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>All was quiet until about midnight, when we distinctly
heard footsteps coming up the stairs, walking into the
little room I had partitioned off with curtains, which
seemed admirably adapted to their purposes. We could
hear them shuffling, giggling, and whispering, as if they
were enjoying themselves at some surprise they were about
to give us. Occasionally they would come and give our
bed a tremendous shaking, lifting it (and us) entirely
from the floor, almost to the ceiling, and then let us down
with a bang; then pat us with hands. Then they would
retire to the little room, which we subsequently named
&ldquo;the green room.&rdquo; At length we were quiet, and all fell
asleep and slept until late in the morning.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly in through the window, and
mother exclaimed: &ldquo;Can it be possible? Is it really true?
How can we live and endure it? We cannot much longer
stay here alone nights. We must have somebody to
stay with us.&rdquo; Fillmore Grover came to take his lesson,
and mother asked him to tell Calvin she would like to
have him call and see her. (Calvin Brown&rsquo;s mother had
been left a widow when quite young. She was the
daughter of Daniel Hopkins, of Canada West, and belonged
to the Society of Friends. She married out of
the society, which was then against their discipline. She
placed her oldest child, Calvin, in a military school; and
when she found herself gradually failing in strength, she
wrote to her father, who came and took her home, with
her three younger children. She returned once to Rochester,
and requested mother to look after Calvin, and care
for him as she would for her own child, if she should not
recover. His mother died, and he called my parents father
and mother; the same as the rest of us.)</p>

<p>He called at about two o&rsquo;clock. We all sat down and
related what had happened and what we had witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
during the past night. He promised to come and stay
there at night; but he advised us to ask no questions, nor
give them any encouragement, as he considered them evil
spirits. To this we all agreed.</p>

<p>He came that night, and we were allowed to rest
quietly until about two o&rsquo;clock, when we were all awakened
by a disturbance in the &ldquo;green room.&rdquo; Everything seemed
to be in commotion, but, as Calvin was in the house, I felt
more confidence in myself. I asked them to please behave
themselves. At this, one Spirit walked around, as if on
his bare feet. He answered my question by stamping on
the floor. I was amused&mdash;although afraid. He seemed
so willing to do my bidding that I could not resist the
temptation of speaking to him as he marched around my
bed. I said, &ldquo;<em>Flat-Foot</em>,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> can you dance the Highland
fling?&rdquo; This seemed to delight him. I sang the music
for him, and he danced most admirably. This shocked
mother, and she said, &ldquo;O Leah, how can you encourage
that fiend, by singing for him to dance?&rdquo; I soon found
that they took advantage of my familiarity, and gathered
in strong force around us. And here language utterly fails
to describe the incidents that occurred. Loud whispering,
giggling, scuffling, groaning, death-struggles, murder
scenes of the most fearful character&mdash;I forbear to describe
them. Mother became so alarmed that she called to Calvin
to come up-stairs. He came&mdash;angry at the Spirits, and
declared that &ldquo;he would conquer, or die in the attempt.&rdquo;
This seemed to amuse them. They went to his bed, raised
it up and let it down, and shook it violently. He was
still determined not to yield to them.</p>

<p>Before Calvin came up-stairs, and during a short lull in
their performances, we quickly removed our beds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
floor, hoping thereby to prevent them from raising us up
and letting us down with such violence. Calvin said, as
he came up, that we were foolish to make our beds on the
floor, as it pleased the Spirits to see how completely they
had conquered us. So he laid down on his bed, and quietly
waited developments. Mother said, &ldquo;Calvin, I wish
your bed was on the floor, too. We have not been disturbed
since we left the bedstead.&rdquo; Calvin remarked,
&ldquo;They are up to some deviltry now. I hear them.&rdquo; He
no sooner uttered these words, than a shower of slippers
came flying at him as he lay in his bed. He bore this
without a murmur. The next instant he was struck violently
with his cane. He seized it and struck back, right
and left, with all his strength, without hitting anything;
but received a palpable <em>bang</em> in return for every thrust he
made. He sprang to his feet and fought with all his
might. Everything thrown at him he pitched back to
them, until a brass candlestick was thrown at him, cutting
his lip. This quite enraged him. He pronounced a solemn
malediction, and, throwing himself on the bed, vowed
he would have nothing more to do with &ldquo;fiendish Spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not long permitted to remain in quiet there.
They commenced at his bedstead and deliberately razed
it to the floor, leaving the head-board in one place, the
foot-board in another, the two sides at angles, and the bed-clothes
scattered about the room. He was left lying on
his mattress, and for a moment there was silence; after
which some slight movements were heard in the &ldquo;green
room.&rdquo; I had stowed a large number of balls of carpet-rags
in an old chest standing on the floor, with two
trunks and several other articles on the top of it. It
seemed but the work of a moment for them to get at the
carpet-balls, which came flying at us from every direction,
hitting us in the same place every time. They took us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for their target, and threw with the skill of an archer.
Darkness made no difference with them, and if either of
us attempted to remonstrate against such violence, they
would instantly give <em>the remonstrant</em> the benefit of a ball.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. We were greatly depressed,
and decided to leave things as they were. After breakfast
we concluded to visit Mount Hope Cemetery. We
returned late, and retired immediately after supper.
While sitting on our bed-side (on the floor), deliberating
in our own minds what was best to do, we were suddenly
startled by a tremendous knocking on the roof of the house.
(The raps always appear to be made on the opposite side
of the door, or floor, table, etc.) We implored them to
stay where they were (as it seemed the noises were outside
the house), and let us alone; but no sooner was the request
made, than a sound slap was given us each, as if in
reproof of what we had been saying. A second slap, as
if with an open hand, was administered to Cathie, when
she cried out, &ldquo;O, look!&rdquo; We all saw what seemed to
be the form of a large man, lying across the foot of our
bed, breathing irregularly, and apparently in great distress.
(The sheet was wrapped around him, muffled
closely about his neck.) His gurgling manifestation was
terrific, and produced a sensible vibration. We pitied
him. He appeared like one passing through the agonies
of death. While we were contemplating this figure, another
slap came upon Cathie,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and she fell to all appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
lifeless. We were greatly alarmed at this terrible
manifestation. We knew nothing of Clairvoyance, Magnetism,
or Trance Mediums, at that time. We had no
one to advise us, and we were nearly distracted. Calvin
took a looking-glass and held it close to Cathie&rsquo;s mouth, but
we could discern no signs of life. Finally we were on the
point of calling some one in, when a deep groan announced
that she lived. We held her hands, but could
not perceive the slightest pulsation. After remaining in
this unconscious state for some time, she again moaned
piteously and raised her hand, pointing at something she
saw, and explained to us afterward. We asked many
questions which she answered by pressing our hands.
She described the terrible occurrence at the Hydesville
house, and when the influence left her, she wept inconsolably
for a long time.</p>

<p>After she became quiet a holy influence fell upon her,
and she repeated twenty or thirty verses of poetry. I can
only remember the last line of each verse, which was:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To be with Christ is better far.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After this things changed somewhat. We heard the
sounds at all times of day and night, variously located in
different parts of the house, but in a much milder form;
unless some of us attempted to go contrary to their wishes.
Often at meal-time the table would be gradually agitated,
and Calvin in particular would be more disturbed than the
rest of us. Once he arose from his chair and reached
across the table for a heavy pitcher of water, when the
chair was instantly removed and he sat down on the floor,
spilling the water all over himself. He instantly arose
and with an execration denounced the whole thing as the
work of the devil and his imps. Of course we laughed
at his calamity, and he thought we should not encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
such things by laughing at them. He often laughed about
it, years afterward, as heartily as we had done.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>We had stored our winter provisions in the cellar.
Among them were several barrels of apples, potatoes, turnips,
etc. From this cellar came the apples, potatoes, and
turnips flying across our room, hitting all in precisely the
same place every time. It will now be remembered that
these articles were in the cellar on the ground floor, and
had to come from the rear of the cellar, through the door,
into the kitchen, through the kitchen, up the stairs, into
the pantry on the second floor, through the pantry into the
dining-room, up the second flight of stairs, into the large
room in which we slept, hitting us as we lay in our beds
near the front window. The reader can trace their pathway
from departure to arrival at their destination on the
diagram of the three stories.</p>

<p>A cabinet shop was the next thing represented by the
Spirits. They seemed to be possessed of all kinds of tools
to work with. After sawing off boards they would let them
fall heavily on the floor, jarring everything around them.
Then after planing, jointing, driving nails, and screwing
down the lid of a coffin, they would shove the hollow
sounding article about the room. (This we understood at
a later day.) Often, to our utter amazement, pickets from
the discarded lots in the cemetery came flying through the
room over our heads, on our beds, like débris in a tornado.
They came from the extreme west side of the burying-ground,
through <em>that</em> lot, and the distance of two hundred
feet through <em>our</em> lot; an entire distance of about four hundred
feet. That they came by no visible means, we knew;
as no human power could have thrown them through the
air into our chamber window, hitting us on our beds, in
the same place every time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vick and her three daughters lived in the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
house, on the same foundation as our own. She was a
very quiet neighbor, and sympathized with us. She was
a native of England, and related many interesting and
strange things which she had witnessed in her own
family.</p>

<p>I did not wish to encourage the manifestations, and we
seldom asked questions. At this time, our troubles (in
Rochester) were not known to any one except Mrs. Vick
and our own family. But things were coming to a fearful
crisis. We closed our windows and did not raise our
shades during the day. This seemed to annoy the Spirits
more than anything else we had done, and caused them to
make a change in their manifestations. Calvin had gone
away with his (military) company, and we were left alone
several days, at the mercy of the Spirits. We had the
consolation of knowing that we had never harmed <em>any one</em>,
and we could see no reason why the Spirits should wish to
<em>harm us</em>.</p>

<p>We called on our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Post, and told
them our story, which afforded them no little amusement
at our expense. They were friends of our family, and
listened attentively to our statement, believing we were
suffering under some psychological delusion. But when they
came to examine for themselves, and witnessed the manifestations
<em>in their own house</em>, they began to think we were
not so entirely deluded as they had supposed. As soon as
they became interested, they begged permission to invite
some friends of theirs. We consented to let Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Bush, and Mr. and Mrs. Lyman Granger come as
they were friends of our family, provided they would keep
the matter a profound secret. But we soon found it was
not long to be so kept.</p>

<p>At times, when we were overcome with anxiety, we
would all kneel down with mother, and pray for protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
We had become satisfied that no earthly power
could relieve us. While on our knees, pins would be stuck
into different parts of our persons. Mother&rsquo;s cap would
be removed from her head, her comb jerked out of her
hair, and every conceivable thing done to annoy us. We
resolved to rest, as best we could, during the day; but
would, on our knees, pray to have these evil doings suppressed.
Often did my dear anxious mother exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;What
have we done? What have <em>have we</em> done, that we should
be so tormented? Dear children, pray to God to have
mercy upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My little sister Katie would sometimes say, &ldquo;<em>I can&rsquo;t
pray, I feel more like swearing</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One evening they had been more quiet than usual.
We remained some time at the table, and began to hope
that things were going to be better with us, when we were
suddenly startled and shocked by sounds from the piano,
which was open in the parlor. The lower bass key tolled
the death-knell, solemnly and distinctly, while we sat at
the table, unable for a time to stir. At length I went into
the parlor, closed the piano, locked it, and took the key
with me; but the sounds kept on. No other demonstrations
were made during the night, but the tolling of that
knell inside the locked piano. While this solemn sound
was made, they would make no other disturbances.</p>

<p>Calvin had not yet returned. The door-bell rang, and
Mr. and Mrs. Post came in. On hearing these sounds Mr.
Post went for Mr. and Mrs. Bush. When Mr. Bush came
and listened to the solemn sounds a few minutes, he fell
upon his knees and prayed to God to sustain this family if,
in his great wisdom, he had chosen them as instruments
through whom mankind should be benefited. Still the
dreadful sounds continued until about one o&rsquo;clock. Our
friends left, and we retired to our sleeping-rooms to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and rest, if possible. We seldom all slept at once, as we
were sure to be disturbed by some frightful exhibition, if
we allowed our light to go out. We were getting ready
for bed, when we heard a wagon drive up to the side gate
and a familiar voice say &ldquo;Whoa&rdquo; to his horses. Mother
hastened to the door, and called out, &ldquo;Oh! Stephen, who
is dead? We have had a terrible warning of death, all
night.&rdquo; Stephen, my sister Maria&rsquo;s husband, replied,
&ldquo;No one is dead, that I know of. But David&rsquo;s little Ella
was supposed to be dying when I left, I have come to take
you back with me.&rdquo; He fed his horses, rested a short time
on the sofa, and about four o&rsquo;clock started for Arcadia,
with mother and Maggie. The sounds on the piano ceased.
When we received a message from Arcadia, it was to this
effect: that dear little Ella was alive when they reached
home, but died the next day.</p>

<p>We had been warned, in the spring, when I was there
in company with Mrs. Grover and Mrs. Granger, that a
death would take place in our family. The words were
written on a block of wood corresponding exactly with
those the children had brought from the new house which
was being built by my father, within speaking distance of
brother David&rsquo;s home. The communication, written in
plain letters and thrown through the open window in broad
daylight, read as follows: &ldquo;One of your family will die.
She will be happy with the angels; mourn not for her.&rdquo;
I believed it would be mother, as she was so broken down
and unhappy. We feared that she would not endure it
much longer.</p>

<p>The writing on the block had always troubled me. I
was in the room when it was thrown in, and knew that
no human power could have thrown it in at that window
and escaped instant detection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ROCHESTER (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Ventriloquism&mdash;&ldquo;Proclaim these Truths to the World&rdquo;&mdash;The
Call for the Alphabet&mdash;Voices in Raps&mdash;God&rsquo;s Telegraph
between the two Worlds&mdash;An Eviction&mdash;Committee of
Five&mdash;No Money Accepted&mdash;Improper Questions to Spirits&mdash;&ldquo;Done&rdquo;&mdash;Struggle

Franklin.</p>


<p>Mother and Maggie returned in about two weeks to
Rochester, expecting to remain with us until the new house
was finished. But &ldquo;a change came over the spirit of our
dream.&rdquo; Things in spiritual matters grew from bad to
worse. Our kind friend, Mrs. Vick, had died suddenly
during mother&rsquo;s absence, and the family soon gave up the
house. It was rented by a new tenant, a diminutive,
sickly-looking man who could not stand the &ldquo;racket.&rdquo; His
wife complained to him, and declared that she was afraid
to remain at home with the children while he was absent.
One day, while they were eating dinner, they heard
knocks on their table. He was furious in his irritation at
this, and coming up to me said: &ldquo;You are ventriloquists,
and I will put a stop to your doings. I will have you
arrested if I ever hear any noises in my house again.&rdquo; I
doubt if he had finished eating his dinner. He was very
pale and trembled with excitement. My neighbor, Mrs.
Bush, a very intelligent and talented lady, had called on
me, and took up the argument in my behalf herself. She
said to him: &ldquo;Inasmuch as the sounds have been in your
house, which have disturbed Leah all the morning, I
think, if any one is arrested, you should be the one.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spirits took &ldquo;a new cue&rdquo; from this visit of our
neighbor. They seemed determined to take measures to
satisfy him that his attempt to interfere with, or stop their
manifestations, did not accomplish that object. They
were, apparently, determined to settle the question of ventriloquism
beyond any future doubt. They sounded their
trumpets upon the house-top. In other words they carried
on the manifestations on the very peak of the roof. It
sounded like the frequent discharge of heavy artillery. It
was stated to us, the next day, that the sounds were heard
a mile away. We feared that the roof would fall in upon
us. We all fell upon our knees and prayed for protection.
We were in this position when Calvin returned. That
night the sounds continued until daylight. The furniture
on the second floor moved in every direction. Books were
thrown about the room. The bureau in the bed-room was
moved so that it blocked up the door. The music, from
the parlor, flew at us while at breakfast in the dining-room.
We knew not what to do. We had been in the
habit of conversing by putting direct questions, which
could be answered affirmatively or negatively; but we did
not think of getting the alphabet, until our dear friend
<em>Isaac Post</em> came in. He said to me, &ldquo;Leah, why, don&rsquo;t
thee remember that thy brother David conversed with the
Hydesville Spirits by using the alphabet? Perhaps they
will explain what is wanted, if thee will call the alphabet
now.&rdquo; This seemed to be exactly what they <em>did</em> want;
and I asked the question, &ldquo;Do you want to say something
to us?&rdquo; There was a tremendous rapping in answer. I
then commenced calling the alphabet, letter by letter in
its order; and the first message we ever obtained in Rochester,
through the Spirits, was this: &ldquo;Dear friends, you
must proclaim these truths to the world. This is the
dawning of a new era; and you must not try to conceal it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any longer. When you do your duty, God will protect
you; and good Spirits will watch over you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked if the Spirits would give me a <em>signal</em> by which
I might know when they wanted us to use the alphabet.
They then spelled, &ldquo;We will rap five times, in quick succession;
and you will know whenever it is called for.&rdquo;
When this was concluded there was a tremendous rapping
all over the room; and then each one gave his own distinctive
signal. They have been continued from that day
to this.</p>

<p>By this I mean that they gave their several rappings
with such differences in sound as to be quite distinct from
each other, and almost as clearly recognizable as would be
their intonations of voice as speakers, or signatures as
writers. On the occasion here mentioned I think there
must have been a score of spirits who rapped one after the
other, some on the table, some on the door, ceiling, windows,
floor, etc. Some were loud, some low, some rapid and
some slower, and no two of them seemed quite the same.
Many persons who are familiar with these signals frequently
identify them by the sounds.</p>

<p>I soon received letters from various places saying that
it had been made known through clairvoyants, speaking
mediums and seers, that the same signal had been given to
all mediums.</p>

<p>Thus we see that God&rsquo;s Telegraph<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ante-dated that of
Samuel F.&nbsp;B. Morse.</p>

<p>This work progressed too slowly to suit the Spirits. We
could not consent to let it be publicly known that we were
having such marvellous disturbances. So they sought out
a new way to coerce us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>One night there was a great uproar in the other house.
Loud rappings were heard, the little man&rsquo;s pillow was
jerked from under his head, his wife nearly fainted, his
children screamed, and he was badly frightened. He could
stand it no longer. He arose in the middle of the night,
and called up a party of his church brethren, who went to
his house and witnessed the demonstrations. They then
went to the office of my landlord and got his concurrence,
and obtained a warrant for our removal from our house.
It will be recollected that this was Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Bennett, to
whom, when I engaged the house of him, I said I wanted
a new house where no crime had been committed, as I believed
the house I lived in was haunted; and that he replied,
&ldquo;I think you will have no difficulty on that account.&rdquo;
Yet he at once consented to our expulsion because
my little neighbor had heard the sounds in his own house.
The warrant was served in the morning. I immediately
communicated with my friends, who rallied in large numbers,
and before the week was out, we were all settled in
a pleasant little cottage on Troup Street. It was about
September 1, 1849, when we moved into the house. I cannot
let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute to
those dear friends.</p>

<p>They too were ridiculed and persecuted at home and
abroad; but they stood firm, and defended the right, as
they were fully convinced that it only required time to
prove it to the world. Many of those precious souls have
passed to the world beyond, and I know they rejoice in
Heaven to-day over the happy discoveries they made, and
which they tell us have greatly widened their capacity for
usefulness and enjoyment in a higher sphere.</p>

<p>There was a marked difference in the manifestations
during our meals. The rappings seemed more concentrated,
and very near us. The Spirits appeared interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in much that we were saying, and often pressed us approvingly
with their hands. On one occasion a Spirit child
laid its little hands on mine (not in mine), and so long as
I remained quiet and permitted the little angel to do as it
wished to, without disturbing the conditions requisite to
enable it to come so near me, there was no shrinking or
withdrawal on the part of the Spirit, who had thus far
re-entered this mundane sphere to prove to us, beyond a
doubt, that she still lived, and loved us. We could not
doubt it. There was no one to deceive us. The Spirit
was my darling little sister. She pressed us with both
her hands, and kissed them over and over again. We
would close our eyes in daylight and they would kiss us
naturally as in life. We were truly converted, and as
the dear old Methodists used to say, &ldquo;born again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We could then realize that we had something to live for,
something to hope for, in that sacred hour when each
one in our humble group &ldquo;lay at the feet of Jesus,&rdquo; willing
to be guided and directed in the paths of truth and
duty. The alphabet was called for, and the following
message was given and signed by our ever revered grandfather,
known to his family and friends as a man of encyclopædic
knowledge, as well as of noble character. &ldquo;You
need not wait as I did for that great &lsquo;change of heart;&rsquo;
but adopt the course at once and live up to your highest
light. Go where that leads you.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Children</span>:&mdash;The time will come when you
will understand and appreciate this great dispensation.
You must permit your good friends to meet with you and
hold communion with their friends in heaven.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2a">&ldquo;I am your grandfather,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Jacob Smith.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<p>This communication affected us all deeply (particularly
my mother), and brought our souls together sympathetically.
We read it to our visitors. They at once adopted
the plan of sitting around the table with us. This method
immediately, as a consequence, placed the subject before
the community. It was discussed everywhere, both publicly
and privately. Mr. Isaac Post&rsquo;s store was beset,
from morning until night, with inquirers who were anxious
to visit us. As we were situated, our friends felt a delicacy
in bringing strangers to our house, except by previous
arrangement.</p>

<p>In a short time the interest increased to such a degree
that it was thought advisable to form a committee of five
in a convenient part of the city, through whom the rushing
crowd of curiosity seekers could be accommodated.
The names of this committee were Isaac Post, R.&nbsp;D. Jones,
Edward Jones, John Kedzie, and Andrew Clackner. They
were faithful friends, who never permitted any one to
visit us unattended by themselves, or some reliable person.
All through this, and, indeed, for the first two years, we
scorned the idea of receiving money from visitors. We
felt that it would be degrading to accept money for the
exhibition of spiritualism. Our time and business were
greatly interfered with, and the overwhelming question
frequently arose, &ldquo;What shall we do? We cannot endure
this much longer.&rdquo; But there was a course marked out
for us (unconsciously to ourselves) to follow. For a time
we fancied things were going on better, and we felt encouraged,
but we little knew the bitter experience we
were destined to pass through. Many of our visitors were
anxious to learn, through the Spirits, how to make a fortune.
Some wished to know the secrets of others; some,
dissatisfied with their domestic relations, sought the aid of
Spirits to help them out of their difficulty; some wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to know what numbers they should buy in a lottery, to be
successful; others would wish to be advised in their stock
speculations.</p>

<p>To all such questions ready responses were given, but
invariably ended in failures.</p>

<p>This order of investigation brought us in rapport with an
entirely different class of Spirits. They had no particular
motive in tormenting us, but they seemed delighted to
lead us on, and deceive the visitors who sought them in
such a spirit. But, when people sought for communications
of a more elevated character, answers were given
accordingly.</p>

<p>Frequently our friends would become so deeply interested
in their manifestations that they would forget we
were mortal and needed time to recuperate our physical
strength. They did not know that every echo, as it came
through our medium forces, consumed a portion of our
vitality. The Spirit knew this, and would close the séances
by spelling &ldquo;done.&rdquo; This, our friends would sometimes
take exception to, and complain that they should break off
so abruptly. We could not explain, to their satisfaction,
that we were exhausted under the constant pressure of
mind and body. The Spirits, knowing this, would give
the signal &ldquo;done.&rdquo; After this word done was spelled, we
never obtained anything of an elevated character. We
could get physical manifestations, of an independent character,
such as throwing things, and moving furniture in
different parts of the house. <em>Those</em> manifestations seldom
seemed to weaken us, but intellectual communications
given through our immediate brain forces had a weakening
effect upon us when continued too long.</p>

<p>A gentleman (Dr. C.&nbsp;D. Griswold) living in Batavia
had induced his minister (an Episcopal clergyman) to visit
us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>They arrived late; and, after a few questions had been
answered, the word &ldquo;done&rdquo; was spelled. They did not
understand the meaning of this, and continued their questions.
Suddenly a loud rapping, in a distant part of
the room, spelled out, &ldquo;Why the devil do you ask questions
after you have been told done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a terrible damper to us all. The minister
stood aghast, looking first at one and then at the other
with astonishment, as if wondering what kind of creatures
we were. The friend who had brought him was mortified
in the extreme. They remained in town, and called
on us again the next morning. All things were quiet, and
we sat down with these two gentlemen alone. The doctor
asked this question, &ldquo;Will the spirit of my dear father
come and answer my questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately the alphabet was called for, and spelled
out this sentence, &ldquo;When good Spirits say &lsquo;done,&rsquo; you
should not seek for further communications. Order is
heaven&rsquo;s first law, and you should not overtax mediums;
for no good Spirit will answer, after their guardians say
&lsquo;done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor received the explanation favorably, and felt
greatly relieved when he saw his friend, the minister, was
disposed to investigate further. With us all was turmoil
and confusion. When manifestations and communications
were consistent, we believed them to come from good
Spirits; but when they were to the contrary, we condemned
all as evil. We had no religious prejudices, no motive
whatever in establishing theories. We could make no
satisfactory explanations to the various interrogatories,
made by promiscuous parties who were constantly in attendance.</p>

<p>Let me here emphasize the fact that the general feeling
of our family, of all of us, including Calvin Brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who was virtually one of us, was strongly adverse to all this
strange and uncanny thing. We regarded it as a great
misfortune, as it was an affliction, which had fallen upon
us; how, whence or why, we knew not. The influence of
the surrounding opinion of neighbors, and the country
round about, reacted upon us in conformation of our own
natural and educational impressions, that the whole thing
was of evil origin, unnatural, perplexing, and tormenting;
while its unpopularity tended to cast a painful shadow
upon us. We resisted it, struggled against it, and constantly
and earnestly prayed for deliverance from it, even
while a strange fascination attached to these marvellous
manifestations thus forced upon us, against our will, by
invisible agencies and agents whom we could neither resist,
control, nor understand. If our will, earnest desires and
prayers could have prevailed or availed, the whole thing
would have ended then and there, and the world outside
of our little neighborhood would never have heard more
of the Rochester Rappings, or of the unfortunate Fox
family.</p>

<p>But the movement was not in our hands nor under our
control. It had an object, and we, as reluctant and humble
instruments, were in the hands of other and higher wills
and forces, from whom it had proceeded, by whom it was
directed, and, so to speak, engineered. We have since
come to understand that all these events and incidents,
perplexing and distressful as they were to us, were but the
birth-throes of a new truth, which was destined to revolutionize
this world, and establish a communication between
the here and the hereafter; of the Earth and of the
Spirit.</p>

<p>And I may here say that, inasmuch as Electricity and
Magnetism seem to play some part in the machinery of
this intercommunication, it is not surprising that the Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
on the other side who seems to have been the principal
initiator, not to say the inventor of this new development
in the evolution of Humanity, was the great man known to
earthly fame as the father of electrical science, as he was
one of the great fathers of American liberty; he of whom
it has been grandly written that he snatched the lightning
from the sky, and the sceptre from the hand of the tyrant:
the immortal <span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It opened up communication between the two worlds of matter and
spirit, as that of Morse had done between distant places in the material
plane of our life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ROCHESTER</span> (<i>Continued</i>), <span class="smcap">November</span>, 1848.</h2>

<p class="sbt">Light Articles made Immovable&mdash;The Coffins&mdash;Adieu of the
Spirits&mdash;Their Return&mdash;First Steps toward Public Investigation&mdash;&ldquo;Hire
Corinthian Hall&rdquo;&mdash;First Committee of
Investigation&mdash;Second&mdash;Third or &ldquo;Infidel&rdquo; Committee&mdash;Behavior
of a Great Dining-table&mdash;The Tar and Torpedo
Mob.</p>


<p>All this could not have gone on very long in a western
city (as it then was) like Rochester, with its 70,000 inhabitants,
without leading to a state of feeling and opinion
which made it impossible to keep the matter confined to
the limited number of persons who, from time to time, got
access to séances (at our house) held under the auspices of
the committee of five persons previously named.</p>

<p>Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Capron, of Auburn, had been introduced to
us by friends of long standing. He was at that time a
sceptic in almost everything relating to immortality, but
he was an honest man, and soon became thoroughly convinced
of the truth of Spiritualism. We still hoped to
suppress the manifestations, and mother consented to let
Cathie go home with Mr. and Mrs. Capron, imagining by
that means to put a stop to further disturbances. For a
few days there seemed to be a change for the better,
and again mother thought she had accomplished her object;
but all this while the Spirits had been actively employed,
as they soon convinced us by more powerful
demonstrations than ever. They had redoubled their
forces and paraded themselves through every part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
house, standing guard at all the apertures, thus to prevent
any two of us from coming near each other to confer on
any matter, however important we deemed it to be.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1849, scarcely a day passed that
we did not have some new and wonderful exhibition of
the power and intelligence of our strange visitors. At
times things would fly through space, above our heads,
when there was no human form to be seen. The chairs,
tables, and even small articles, would suddenly become so
heavy that no strength that we could exert could move
them. It became a common saying in our house that
&ldquo;the Spirits are holding them down,&rdquo; when we would
have occasion to lift any light article from one place to
another. It was constantly repeated to us that we had &ldquo;a
mission to perform,&rdquo; and we were directed to &ldquo;make
ready for the work.&rdquo; My mother declared that we would
never yield to any such directions again; but the Spirits
said, &ldquo;You have been chosen to go before the world to
convince the sceptical of the great truth of immortality.&rdquo;
It was in vain that we opposed to this a strenuous resistance,
and argued that we had already done enough, and
more than should be required of us. But the constant
burden of their declaration was that we must &ldquo;go forth
and do our duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last they resorted to more violent measures of coercion.
One morning, on awaking, we found four <em>coffins</em>
drawn on the kitchen floor, of life-size, and corresponding
to the different sizes of mother, myself, Margaretta,
and Katie: and after we had washed them away,
we found next morning the same fearful objects on the
ceiling. Twice again was this repeated in the dining-room,
so that they came four times in all. They were
handsomely and artistically drawn in black and white, the
lids being thrown back to show how beautifully they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
done the work of pinking the white linings. Each coffin
had the drawing of its plate, and on them were perfectly
and correctly written our respective names and ages, while
beneath them was also written in large plain letters: &ldquo;If
you do not go forth and do your duty you will soon be laid
in your coffins.&rdquo; We called in our friends to behold the
gruesome sight. Some were superstitious and declared
that they would not dare to disobey such biddings; but
we feared that if we yielded to them, we would become
subject to some unknown evil influences, so that mother
still held out against what did not meet her approval.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to make my reader understand
and realize the scenes we passed through. Crowds of inquirers
came to the house at all hours of the day and evening.</p>

<p>The committee had more than they could attend to;
we had no time to attend to any household duties. My
music pupils had all left, and the question arose: &ldquo;What
shall we do? How can we live so?&rdquo; The new house
was finished, and father wanted us all to come home; but
the Spirits said, &ldquo;No, you cannot go; you must remain
here and do your duty.&rdquo; After a few brief messages to
friends, the Spirits, in a most impressive and solemn manner,
bade us all good-by, and closed their manifestations.
They made the occasion quite solemn, and the company
felt wholly deserted when they became satisfied that the
Spirits had taken their final departure. We tried, on several
occasions, to get the sounds; but could not. The
Spirits remained firm in their decision for twelve days.</p>

<p>Mother now deemed it advisable to return to her home
(in Arcadia, Wayne County), as she was much needed
there, and she hoped we would no longer be disturbed by
Spirits. Margaretta, Calvin, myself, and Alfie, our good
servant, were alone, and the absence of all manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or Spiritual communications caused many a pang of remorse.
Often we wished it were possible for us to enjoy
the society of our dear Spirit friends, without being forced
into that public notoriety and that constant collision with
a hostile world which seemed to be involved in what the
Spirits called the &ldquo;duty&rdquo; which they were urging upon us.</p>

<p>While we were thus in silent waiting, and had given
up all hope of again hearing from our Spirit friends, Mr.
Capron, of Auburn, and Mr. George Willets, of Rochester,
called on us. As we saw them coming, we met them at
the door and informed them that the Spirits would not rap
for us any more. They came into the hall, saying, &ldquo;Perhaps
they will rap for us, if not for you.&rdquo; And so they
did. They came with the well-known joyous sounds, all
over the hall, as if they were glad to meet us all again.
We could not repress our great satisfaction at the renewal
of our enjoyment, for we now felt that there had really
been enjoyment in it, however mingled with perplexity
and distress. It was, to us, like the return of long absent
friends, whose value, while with us, we had not sufficiently
appreciated.</p>

<p>It was during this interview that the Spirits again
broached the subject of a public investigation. Directions
were given to have the whole matter made public.</p>

<p>They then detailed their plan to us in a lengthy communication.
They told us what was required of us, and
what they declared to be our duty, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all have a duty to perform. We want you to
make the matter more public.&rdquo; To this, Mr. Capron replied
that nothing but the greatest ridicule would be heaped
upon all who should engage in such an undertaking. The
following message immediately came in reply, &ldquo;That will
be so much the better. Your triumph will be so much
the greater!&rdquo; They told Capron and Willets, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
(the Spirits) wanted them to get up meetings for the purpose
of letting the public know this great truth. Our
friends (C. and W.) said in reply to this that they had
families to support; and they could not see how they could
go before the public with a matter which must make them
so decidedly unpopular in the then existing state of public
opinion. The Spirits then directed that we should hold
meetings at different private houses; and they (the Spirits)
would manifest for promiscuous companies. Meetings
were accordingly held at the residences of Messrs. Willets,
Post, Granger, and others. The Spirits fulfilled their
promises admirably. We decided to leave the entire
movement to their direction. We felt powerless to act on
our own judgment. We met at the house of Mr. Isaac
Post to talk over the matter, and learn all we could in regard
to this great step forced upon us in a way so contrary
to our own wishes. We had not been long in the parlor
before the alphabet was called and spelled, &ldquo;Amy, thee
must invite sixteen persons to come here on Saturday
evening, to hear the Spirit rappings.&rdquo; Amy (Mrs. Post)
replied, &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know whom to invite to such an
entertainment. How can I do so?&rdquo; The rapping answered,
&ldquo;I will tell thee: &lsquo;Mr. or Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;: You are invited
<span class="smcap">By the Spirits</span> to call at the house of Mr. Isaac Post
next Thursday evening, at eight o&rsquo;clock, to hear the Spirits
rap.&rsquo;&rdquo; Amy said she did not know whom to invite, and
asked the Spirits if they would give her the names. This
they consented to do, and proceeded to spell out the names
of persons, many of whom neither Mrs. Post nor any one
present knew. They were all lawyers, editors, and doctors.
It is to be regretted that the book containing these
names is lost. Dr. Moore was the only one named who did
not come in answer to the invitation. Frederick Douglass,
editor of <cite>The North Star</cite>, was present. They met, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
have stated, at the house of Isaac Post. They listened,
with respectful attention, to the sounds of the rappings.
A part of the company went into the cellar, and a part
remained in the room above; but the rapping always
seemed to be on the side opposite to the listeners. After
they had satisfied themselves of the reality of the sounds,
and that they were not made by us, they proposed to get
some answers to questions, but the comment or answer of
the Spirits was, &ldquo;No. We invited you here to listen to
the sounds, and not to get communications. Good night.&rdquo;
They did, however, make another appointment for the
next Thursday evening, at the house of Mr. George Willets,
and again all except Dr. Moore came, with some individuals
added to the number, and the sounds were heard
as in the first instance. Again the visitors proposed to
get answers to questions; but again the reply was that
they were only invited to hear the sounds.</p>

<p>This whole proceeding, as they informed us, was to convince
us that they could rap sufficiently loud to be heard
in a public hall.</p>

<p>The Spirits then gave us their directions as follows:
&ldquo;Hire Corinthian Hall&rdquo; (then the largest hall in Rochester).
Margaretta and myself were to go to the hall; Mr. Capron
was to deliver the lecture, in which he was to relate the commencement
at Hydesville, and the progress of it up to the
present time. Mr. Willets was to act as friend and business
man, doorkeeper, etc. A committee of five gentlemen
was to be appointed at each meeting, by the audience,
and instructed to report at the commencement of the next
meeting.</p>

<p>The Spirits who had given the directions had promised
to make the sounds so loud that all in the hall could hear
them. Before the meeting the following names were
spelled out, of persons thus designated to sit on the platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with us: Rev. A. Jervis (Methodist minister),
Lyman Granger (a well-known member of the M.&nbsp;E.
Church), Simeon Draper (a prominent Methodist), Mrs.
Sarah D. Fish (a member of the Society of Friends), and
Mrs. Pierpont. When these names were first spelled out
by the Spirits some of the persons objected to thus going
forward in so unpopular a work, when the Rev. Mr. Jervis
spoke up and said, &ldquo;I know it is true, and I&rsquo;ll face a
frowning world.&rdquo; His emphatic earnestness awoke the
others who had been named, and they all consented to serve.
It should be remembered that the most minute directions
were given by the Spirits, through the use of the alphabet,
without suggestions from any one concerned in the work
to be done. The Spirits told us, moreover, that this was
the best way to interest the public, and prepare them for
a more general acceptance of Spiritual Communication by
the world at large.</p>

<p>Notices were accordingly published in the newspapers
of the meeting to be held in Corinthian Hall, on the evening
of November 14, 1848.</p>

<p>According to the directions of the Spirits, Margaretta
and myself appeared at Corinthian Hall, where a large
audience had already assembled to witness the manifestations
which had excited so much general curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. Capron, in delivering the lecture, depended more
upon his knowledge of the facts, as they had then occurred,
than on any theory of his own, or of others, in
regard to the rappings.</p>

<p>We wished to have the subject carefully scrutinized by
honest committees, and have them report to the public the
result of their investigations. Mr. Capron stated emphatically
that if he could not explain what it was, he certainly
knew what it was not.</p>

<p>It was also announced to the audience that no ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
minds would be accepted on the committees. We had,
at that early day, discovered that the greater the intelligence,
the more satisfactory were the manifestations. At
this lecture the audience listened with very respectful attention.
The editor of a Second Advent paper also
delivered his little speech, telling the audience that the
sounds were spiritual, he had no doubt; but it was the
spirit of the devil, and that the persons in whose presence
the sounds were heard should be cast into prison. He said
his &ldquo;little say,&rdquo; and we never heard of him afterward.</p>

<p>When this episode had closed, the following gentlemen
were named as a Committee of Investigation, and requested
to report the next evening, viz., A.&nbsp;J. Coombs,
Daniel Marsh, Nathaniel Clark, A. Judson, and Edwin
Jones.</p>

<p>Thus the first great step was taken, in order to lay the
facts of Modern Spiritualism before the world. It was
now to be tried in a way by which no guilty person could
hope to escape detection. Any one guilty of fraud as
great as this would have been, had it consisted of simulation
on our part, must certainly have met with swift exposure,
and been stripped of all power or opportunity for
further mischief. In fact, could it be rationally apprehended
that we, or any one, would have dared to face an
adverse public, of a thronged city, and the entire sentiment
of a world against us, as we had been directed to do,
with nothing but a damning falsehood at our backs to lean
upon?</p>

<p>The appointment of an intelligent committee was readily
agreed upon by the audience; and they&mdash;most of them
perhaps&mdash;felt confident that the supposed fraud would now
be probed to the bottom. So sure seemed the editors of
the <cite>Rochester Democrat</cite> that this was &ldquo;the last of the
rappings,&rdquo; that they wrote a long article on the &ldquo;humbug&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which had deceived so many, rejoicing that the end
was near.</p>

<p>But when, on the following evening, the Committee
made their report, the newspaper men were obliged to
substitute something else in place of the anticipated detection
and exposure, as the result of their examination
did not verify the theory of these newspaper quasi-leaders
and instructors of public thought. The following was the
report of the Committee:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without the knowledge of the persons in whose presence
the manifestations are made, the Committee selected
the hall of the &lsquo;Sons of Temperance,&rsquo; for investigation of
the subject under consideration. That the sounds, on the
floor near where the Mediums stood, were heard as distinctly
as at the other places; and that part of the Committee
heard the rapping on the wall behind them; that
a number of questions were asked, which were answered
not altogether right nor altogether wrong; that, in the
afternoon, they went to the house of a private citizen, and
while there, the sounds were heard <em>on the outside</em> (apparently)
of the front door, after they had entered, and on
the door of a closet. By placing the hand upon the
door, there was a sensible jar felt when the rapping was
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the Committee placed one of his hands upon
the feet of the ladies, and the other on the floor, and
though the feet were not moved, there was a distinct jar
of the floor. On the pavement and on the ground the
same sounds were heard; a kind of double rap, as of a
stroke and a rebound, was distinguishable. When the
sisters were separated at a distance from each other, no
sound was heard; but when a third person was interposed
between them, the sounds were heard. The sisters seemed
to give every opportunity to the Committee to investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the case fully, and would submit to a thorough investigation
by a committee of ladies, if desired. They all agree
that the sounds were heard, but they entirely fail to discern
any means by which it could be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the following evening, each member of the Committee
spoke for himself, and they all perfectly agreed as to
the facts stated. Their report was received with surprise
by such of the audience as had come with the expectation
of having the subject exposed as a fraud, and the rappings
stopped.</p>

<p>After some further remarks by Mr. Capron, and a discussion
of a brief character upon the subject, another
Committee was appointed consisting of the following
gentlemen: Dr. H.&nbsp;H. Langworthy, Hon. Frederick
Whittlesey, General D.&nbsp;C. McCallum, William Fisher,
of Rochester, and Hon. A.&nbsp;P. Hascall, of Le Roy, subsequently
member of Congress.</p>

<p>At the meeting, on the evening after this lecture, this
Committee reported that &ldquo;They went into the investigation
at the office of Chancellor Whittlesey, and they heard
the sounds on the floor, on the wall, and on the door; that
the ladies were placed in different positions, and, like the
other Committee, they were unable to tell from what the
sounds proceeded, or how they were made; that Dr. Langworthy
made observations with a stethoscope to ascertain
whether there was any movement of the lungs, and found
not the least difference when the sounds were being made,
and there was no kind of probability or possibility of
their being made by ventriloquism, as some had supposed;
and they could not have been made by machinery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As this report was read, there was a murmur of discontent,
of baffled opposition, and, in some cases, unmistakable
willingness to proceed to violence against all who
had offered every opportunity for fair investigation. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
persons, among the large number congregated there, were
disappointed and indignant at the discovery that it was
<em>not a cheat</em>. A very large number of people were present
on this occasion, and a portion of them seemed determined
that the <em>cause of the deception</em>, or the manner of its performance,
should be ascertained and exposed. They predetermined
that there could be no honesty unless it came
in their old beaten track of belief.</p>

<p>It was during the investigation on this second day, that
Chancellor Whittlesey informed me that he was a friend
to us. He said to me: &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I am a
friend to you and know that these things are true. I have
read &lsquo;Davis&rsquo;s Revelations,&rsquo; and I believe fully that Spirits
can communicate. You shall have a fair investigation.&rdquo;
This was after very insulting and even violent behavior by
Dr. H.&nbsp;H. Langworthy; and it did me a great deal of
good to be so assured by one of the Committee, and one of
the best of them; and also a man who had long been Vice
Chancellor of the State of New York; and whom the
whole country knew as one of the wise men of the time, a
neighbor of ours and known to us.</p>

<p>On the third evening the audience was much larger, and
a portion of them seemed determined that at all hazards,
and cost what it might, it should be exposed. Mr. Warren
L. Burtis declared that &ldquo;those girls would not have him
on the Committee for a hundred dollars;&rdquo; intimating that
<em>he</em> was known to possess unusual facilities for the detection
of fraud. The audience was not looking for the proof
of facts. They constituted a large and self-chosen committee
who seemed to consider it their duty to prove by
anathemas the falsity of Spiritualism. He, W.&nbsp;L. Burtis,
was at once placed on the Committee; and after being so
appointed, he remarked with much importance, if he
&ldquo;could not find it out he would forfeit a new hat.&rdquo; Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Kenyon said, &ldquo;If I cannot fathom the fraud, I will throw
myself over Genesee Falls.&rdquo; He too was immediately
placed on the Committee. All the others chosen as members
were equally opposed to us. The Committee consisted
of Dr. E.&nbsp;P. Langworthy, Dr. J. Gates, William
Fitzhugh, W.&nbsp;L. Burtis, and L. Kenyon. Mr. Packard, a
well-known cabinet-maker, suggested that if he were chosen
he would have a party of ladies to examine the clothing
of the girls, as he believed the sounds were all made by
leaden balls, sewed in the bottom of their dresses. But
Mr. Packard was not chosen, because, as before stated,
the occasion required the application of the higher order
of intelligence. To this, however, no attention was given
by him or others excepting a significant smile of disappointment.
The public had by this time learned that such
leaden-ball suggestions were not less than absurd.</p>

<p>This Committee met at the rooms of Dr. Gates, in the
Rochester House. This was called the &ldquo;Infidel Committee.&rdquo;
The public had heretofore chosen persons of a more
religious character; and men representing the scientific
portion of the inhabitants had now concluded that, by
placing the subject in the hands of scientific infidels, they
would &ldquo;fathom the fraud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This party now chosen were disgusted by the reflection
that they were to enter upon such an undertaking; but
they had been chosen, and would serve and do their duty
to the public. This Committee appointed three ladies,
who took us into a private room, disrobed and clothed us
with garments of their own selection, after which we
seated ourselves around a table; but no manifestations of
any importance were made. Disappointed in not finding
any machinery, they had a lurking suspicion that we had
doffed it for the occasion.</p>

<p>They called on the &ldquo;Ghosts&rdquo; to manifest themselves if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
they could, but no responses came to such invitations.
They now concluded it was about dinner-time, and said to
us, &ldquo;You can go home and get your dinner. Perhaps the
ghosts will be more sociable in the afternoon;&rdquo; plainly intimating
that we could go home and prepare ourselves for
rapping, and that things would be more satisfactory after
our return. It was now my turn to be the speaker; I told
them: &ldquo;No, we shall not stir from this room until the
time for this investigation shall expire; which will be at
six o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span>&rdquo; Some of the Committee exclaimed,
&ldquo;Good for the Rappers! That looks like business.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us have dinner in this room.
We will give the girls fair play.&rdquo; A sumptuous dinner
was prepared and brought in to us, and all took seats at
the table. They taunted us in every way. Sometimes
we felt ourselves forsaken, and disposed to give up in despair.
Our friends were locked out, and not permitted to
come into the room; but we could hear their faithful
footsteps outside the door, in the hall of the hotel&mdash;Isaac
and Amy Post, Mr. and Mrs. Pierpont, George Willets,
and others. My young sister Maggie was by my side,
bathed in tears. Dr. Gates was carving. I was struggling
with a choking emotion, and could not taste food. The
party were joking and funning at our expense, when, suddenly
the great table began to tremble, and raised first one
end and then the other, with loud creaking sounds, like a
ship struggling in a heavy gale, until it was finally suspended
above our heads.</p>

<p>For a moment all were silent and looked at each other
with astonishment. The waiters fled in every direction.
Instantly the scene was changed. The ladies threw their
arms around us, one after another; and it was their turn
to cry.</p>

<p>They said to us: &ldquo;Oh, you poor girls, how you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been abused! Oh, how sorry we are for you; after all, <em>it
is true</em>!&rdquo; The gentlemen with one accord said, &ldquo;Girls, you
have gained a victory. We will stand by you to the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let it be understood that this Committee of ladies and
gentlemen took us to the parlors of the Rochester House,
which could be divided into two rooms by closing the folding-doors.
After dinner the gentlemen of the Committee
insulated the table by putting glass under the legs, procured
two sacks of feathers, and advised the ladies how to
conduct the investigation. They then closed the doors,
and (the gentlemen of the Committee having retired) left
us and the lady members of the Committee alone. By this
time the Committee had become kindly disposed toward
us. They suggested to us that we should stand upon the
sacks of feathers on the table, with our dresses tied tight
above our ankles. We complied with all their suggestions,
cheerfully. Immediately the sounds were heard on the
table, floor, and walls. The ladies instantly opened the
doors, and the gentlemen came in and witnessed the manifestations
themselves.</p>

<p>The ladies, at my suggestion, signed the following certificate:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they were standing on pillows, with a handkerchief
tied around the bottom of their dresses, tight to
their ankles, we all heard the rapping on the table, on
the wall, and floor distinctly.</p>

<p class="sgn1">&ldquo;Mrs. Stone.<br />
&ldquo;Mrs. J. Gates.<br />
&ldquo;Miss M.&nbsp;P. Lawrence.&rdquo;<br /></p>


<p class="cl">Before we left the room, word was sent to the Committee,
saying, &ldquo;Do not go to the Hall this evening; for if
you report favorably to the girls you will be mobbed.&rdquo;
Our friends, who anticipated a riot and feared for our
safety, as soon as we got to the house after this terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
day&rsquo;s work and anxiety, urged us not to go to the Hall.
But what were we to do? Even the Committee were
threatened if it made a favorable report; but they all informed
us that they would protect us in any event.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;W. Capron and George Willets said, &ldquo;What are we
to do, if you forsake us at such a time?&rdquo; Amy Post said,
&ldquo;Go, I will go with you.&rdquo; The Spirits spelled, &ldquo;Go, God
will protect you. You will not be harmed.&rdquo; Margaretta
had been so harassed during the day, and had been so
urged by some of her friends, that she resolved not to go
to the Hall that night. This would have spoiled all our
success so far. It would be utter ruin to us. Amy Post
(that darling little Quaker lady), who stood firm as a rock,
said, &ldquo;We will go and sit down by ourselves, and see how
we shall feel about it.&rdquo; I soon said, &ldquo;Amy, if you will go,
I will go with you, if I go to my death.&rdquo; Margaretta did
not change her mind until we were preparing to go, when
she said, &ldquo;I cannot have you go without me. I must go,
although I expect we will be killed.&rdquo; So we all went.
We found the faithful friends, who were appointed to sit
on the platform, already in their places. There were but
few words said by Mr. Capron, as every one was anxious
to hear the report of the Committee. When it was made,
it was more full than any of the others. It rehearsed the
fact that they had excluded from the room, in which the
examination was conducted, all our friends, and we were
left alone to fight the battle. Each member of the Committee
reported separately, agreeing with, and corroborating
the first statement.</p>

<p>The reports of the different committees did not satisfy
the rowdy element, which at this time had become a
howling mob, who were predetermined to assault us, and
also the last Committee, if they did not report against
us. They even warmed tar, and had it concealed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
closet at the head of the stairway adjacent to the door of
the Hall. Some of our friends, knowing this, took the
precaution of calling on the police. Our Committee was
informed of the proceedings of the mob, and when we
separated at six o&rsquo;clock and went to Mr. Post&rsquo;s to await
the hour of meeting at the Hall, declared to us that they
would stand by us, in these words: &ldquo;Never fear, girls,
you have gained the victory; we will stand by you to the
last.&rdquo; And they did, nobly.</p>

<p>We were directed by the Spirits to go forth and submit
to everything lawful; but that the committees chosen by
the audience should be composed of such as represented
the best intelligence of the community.</p>

<p>Josiah Bissel was the presiding genius of the mob. He
had caused to be purchased some torpedoes which he distributed
among his rowdy friends to throw upon the floor,
and thus begin disturbance. It had been agreed upon by
his bosom friends (the rowdy element) that he should ascend
the platform, and with a long heavy stick, which he
carried as a cane, give a signal for the onslaught. The
other leaders in this mob were Lawrence R. and Leonard
W. Jerome, Alderman Lewis Seelye, Major Packard, and
others, awaiting the signal. But no sooner was it given
them than a fine, large, respectable-looking gentleman
sprang upon the platform and took a seat between myself
and my sister, whose hand he took in his. I thought, at
the moment, he was an enemy, and ordered him to leave,
and not dare touch my sister. He replied, &ldquo;I am your
friend; I am the Chief of Police&mdash;look, these men in
front are all my men; and they have come to protect
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sound of the signal made by Bissel, the mob
rushed to the platform. Torpedoes were heard in every
part of the Hall. The Chief of Police quietly informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Josiah Bissel that if any one was taken into custody he
would be the man.</p>

<p>As the mob began their demonstrations, one gentleman,
Mr. Alfred Hubbell, who had been an investigator at our
house, raised his hand and said in a loud voice: &ldquo;Girls,
you have nothing to fear. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I have fifty
good men here all ready to protect you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Abelard Reynolds, proprietor of the Hall, was on
the platform, determined to stand between us and the mob.
The ringleaders of the mob, followed by their gang, quickly
disappeared. Our work, as planned by the Spirits, for
that time was done. Our triumph was complete. The
promises of our Spirit friends and directors were all fulfilled.
However they may have allowed suspicion to come
upon us, which it was not in their power to prevent, they
had always brought us safe and sound out of the apparent
difficulty, and gained a signal triumph through our humble
agency.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">MEDIUMISTIC VEIN IN OUR FAMILY.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Some Family Antecedents&mdash;Our Great-grandmother&mdash;Phantom
Prophetic Funerals&mdash;Vision of a Tombstone Nine
Years in Advance, etc.</p>


<p>I will here interrupt the course of this narrative with
a chapter about our family, principally in reference to
that peculiar and strange constitutional <em>something</em>, which,
in us three children (myself and the two younger ones,
Margaretta and Catharine), has come out so strongly into
what is called &ldquo;mediumship,&rdquo; and which would seem to
have been the cause why the &ldquo;Spirits,&rdquo; whose instruments
we have been, chose us for their purpose, and imposed
upon us the burden of what they called &ldquo;the duty,&rdquo;
against which we thus so long and hard, but vainly, struggled.</p>

<p>My parents were both native-born Americans. My
father&rsquo;s ancestors were German; the name having been
originally Voss, which passed through Foss into Fox. In
my mother&rsquo;s family, French, English, and Dutch mingled.
Her paternal grandfather, John C. Smith, was of
English ancestry. He married Elizabeth Blauvelt, of descent
from Holland. Her maternal grandfather was
French, Rutan by name, and her maternal grandmother,
whose maiden name was Margaret Ackerman, was also a
descendant from Holland, and resided on Long Island
with her parents until her marriage, after which she removed
to New York City, where her only child, my
grandmother, was born. She (Margaret Rutan), my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mother&rsquo;s maternal grandmother, had, from childhood,
evinced the power of foretelling events. She frequently
followed phantom funerals, and entering the grave-yard,
would stand and look on until the last rites had been performed,
after which she would turn away sorrowing. She
never felt timid until the ceremony was ended. Then she
would find herself alone, in her normal condition, and remembering
all she had seen, and knowing also what would
inevitably follow, she would be sadly depressed.</p>

<p>On two occasions she was prevailed upon to tell whose
funeral she had attended the previous night, which caused
her such intense distress of mind, she besought them to
never again urge her to reveal that which was made known
to her during her somnambulic walks. The moment the
person ceased to breathe, she would say, &ldquo;Mr. or Mrs.
(whoever it might be) is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the death had taken place in a distant part of the
country it would make no difference, so long as the burial
place was there. She felt relieved as soon as the event
transpired. She always visited the grave-yard between
the hours of twelve and two o&rsquo;clock at night. My grandfather
frequently walked slowly after her to accompany
her home on her return.</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature used to attend these nocturnal
excursions of my great-grandmother, in the somnambulic
condition, when she would thus witness the celebration
of funerals of persons who were at the time still alive
and well. She would see and recognize all the persons in
attendance on the funeral, from the officiating minister
down, and afterward remember and relate their names,
which used always to correspond with the fact as it afterward
came about. She would even tell by whose horses
the body was brought to the grave (in the country at that
time there were no regular hearses, and this service was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
performed by some friend or neighbor). When the
crowded phantom funeral was over she would awake to
find herself alone in the graveyard; sometimes with my
grandfather (her son-in-law) awaiting at a little distance to
accompany her return home. But frequently she had no
such watching attendant, and I remember to have heard it
said how distressing it would be for her to awake entirely
alone and make her solitary way homeward, from what
she knew to be the foreshadowed interment of some one
near and dear.</p>


<h3>MY AUNT ELIZABETH&rsquo;S VISION OF HER OWN TOMBSTONE.</h3>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Higgins, had much
the same faculty. She never left her bed at night to visit
scenes about to transpire, but nearly everything of importance
was foreshadowed in her dreams. She would
frequently relate them on the morning following. One
morning, she gave us a relation of her dream. She said,
laughingly, to her brother: &ldquo;I dreamed I had a fall, last
night. You and I were riding on horseback, when suddenly
my horse stumbled and fell in front of Judge Perry&rsquo;s
door. I rolled down the little embankment, and Tom
Foot came and helped me up.&rdquo; Grandmother said, &ldquo;That
can&rsquo;t come true, for Tom is, by this time, far away.&rdquo; They
thought no more of it.</p>

<p>Some time after, her brother said to her, &ldquo;Bessie, would
you like to take a ride with me this morning?&rdquo; She replied
that she would, and they soon started off, each on a
spirited horse, never thinking of her dream, until the
horse stumbled and she fell and rolled down the bank, exactly
in front of Judge Perry&rsquo;s door. <em>Tom</em> came out and
helped her up. He had not gone away, as he had contemplated
doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Dale Owen, in his &ldquo;Foot-falls on the Boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Another World,&rdquo; has given a more detailed account
of her remarkable dreams. I will only add the last sad
fulfilment of a dream which she had some years previously
to its fulfilment. She was then in her nineteenth year.
She said, &ldquo;I dreamed I was in a new country, walking
alone, when suddenly I came to a small cemetery, and,
walking up to one of the most prominent head-stones, read
the inscription, which was this:</p>

<p class="tomb"><span class="f8">IN MEMORY</span><br />
<span class="f6">OF</span><br />
<span class="f9">ELIZABETH SMITH</span>,<br />
Wife of H&mdash;&mdash;,<br />
Who departed this life<br />
In the year of our Lord 18&mdash;,<br />
Aged 27 years, 8 months and 26 days.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></p>


<p>She was deeply impressed by this dream, and could not
rest. She left her bed, and went into her mother&rsquo;s sleeping-room,
sobbing, and related the dream. Her father
and mother both endeavored to disabuse her mind of any
belief in this unhappy dream. He tenderly folded her in
his arms and quoted from Scripture many beautiful sayings,
such as: &ldquo;Of that day and hour knoweth no man:
no, not even the angels in Heaven.&rdquo; She was comforted
and seldom referred to her dream. The gentleman to
whom she was affianced died. Her father purchased a
home, and moved to Sodus, Wayne County, N.&nbsp;Y., where
she became acquainted with Mr. C. Higgins. They were
married, and enjoyed five years of uninterrupted happiness.
The time was drawing near when she expected to
become a mother. Uncle Charles was a devoted husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and regretted that duty called him from home at this time.
(He was engaged in Albany on public business.) He
could not rest; he must return to his darling little wife,
and spend a few days with her, and arrange with his
brother, Dr. Higgins, to remain as a protector and physician
in his house, until all danger had passed. He came
(to her) unexpected, and she was delighted to see him.</p>

<p>The doctor came to remain as long as it was necessary.
Her husband had already overstaid his time; and, as it
was important for him to be in Albany, he was obliged to
leave. There were many anxious hearts that feared, and
silently prayed that their hopes of happiness might be
realized. (I really do think that she had been reasoned
out of belief in <em>that</em> dream.) She rejoiced and was happy
when he promised her he would never again accept an
office which would take him from home.</p>

<p>It was a bright, lovely morning. The team stood waiting
at the gate, to take him to Newark (ten miles), the
nearest point from which he could reach the canal packet
boat, for Albany. Bessie walked with him to the gate
(about two hundred feet from the door), where he tenderly
embraced her and kissed her again and again, promising
that he would refrain from leaving home on business
in the future. He alluded in glowing terms to their prospects
of happiness, in the birth of their expected child,
and warned her of the danger of yielding to superstition.
He begged her not to repeat her dreams, as they were the
result of a disordered condition of health. Then, taking
her in his arms, he carried her back to the house, saying:
&ldquo;My darling, I cannot part with you here at the gate;
permit me to remember you as seated in your pleasant
room, surrounded by loving friends, and happy again.&rdquo;
He held her in a long, fond embrace, kissing her with
tears and sobs, and gently seating her in her easy-chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
bade her farewell, and rushed to the conveyance, fearing
to look back, lest he should see her weeping at the door.</p>

<p>She wept some time after he was gone, but soon felt
more cheerful, and frequently repeated what he had promised&mdash;that
he would never leave home again after that
season.</p>

<p>A week had passed, and a little voice was heard. She
fondly clasped her babe to her breast and called it &ldquo;My
little Charles, my darling baby! Oh! how happy I am.&rdquo;
They were both doing well. Letters were sent to her husband
by every mail, which were duly received by him.
She wished the child would resemble his father, who was
a splendid man in every sense. She too was perfect in
form and feature.</p>

<p>It was the day on which she had attained her age of
twenty-seven years, eight months, and twenty-six days,
<em>the age marked on the tombstone she had seen in her dream
of about nine years before</em>. All the family knew of it,
though she gave no sign of thinking of it, and seemed entirely
cheerful and happy.</p>

<p>The little one was two weeks old; a letter was received
that morning saying, &ldquo;I shall be at home the last of this
week. I shall say farewell to Albany.&rdquo; Words cannot
express her joy at this unexpected announcement. She
directed everything, how to dress the baby, and arranged
for them to go after her husband&rsquo;s mother and sister, who
had not seen the little one, as they had been absent on a
visit. They were delighted to find Bessie and the baby so
well, and the little Charles looking &ldquo;so exactly like his
father, except that he had his mother&rsquo;s curly hair.&rdquo; The
mother seemed perfectly happy, but there were anxious
hearts that silently prayed to God to avert the fearful
calamity, which they feared might now be hanging over
them. The day was passing away. She was well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
cheerful. Her family were near her, doing all they could
to divert her thoughts from <em>the date</em>. Her minister, Rev.
Mark Johnson, and his wife called to spend an hour with
the family. She was pleased to see them, and united with
them in prayer. She called Mrs. Johnson to see how
sweetly the infant nestled in her bosom. Then, turning
to the minister she said, &ldquo;Mr. Johnson, we shall have the
baby christened Charles Smith Higgins as soon as his
father comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last rays of the setting sun shone on the tree tops.
Once more she called attention to the child, smiling on it
the while; when suddenly she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and
placed one hand upon her breast, while with the other
pressing the babe closer to her bosom.</p>

<p>Mother caught her in her arms, her sister Catharine ran
to call the doctor; but before they could enter the room,
her spirit had taken its flight to the immortal world.</p>

<p>Her tombstone now records her dream, verbatim, in the
old cemetery in Sodus.</p>

<p>They directed letters to her husband and friends in Albany,
also sent letters to every packet-boat going east and
returning. (There were no railroads nor convenient telegraph
wires at that time.) They published the sad news
in all the papers, and sent them to every place where he
would be likely to get them.</p>

<p>He left Albany on Thursday, expecting to reach home
on Sunday. At Lyons he left the boat, thinking he could
reach home some hours sooner by taking a private conveyance.
He met an acquaintance at the hotel, who handed
him a paper containing a &ldquo;special notice&rdquo; of the sudden
death of Mrs. Elizabeth Higgins. He saw no more, but
fell prostrated with overwhelming grief. In vain they
tried to rouse him until the reaction came. The funeral
was appointed for half-past two o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span> He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
twenty miles to ride, and it was nearly one o&rsquo;clock then; he
called for a horse, and started direct for the church, hoping
to reach there before the burial. A large concourse
had already assembled at the house, which was about two
miles distant from the church. All were anxiously looking
and waiting for the absent one. The weather was extremely
warm, and they would proceed slowly; so it was
thought best to start. Several times they halted on the
way. Every eye and ear were strained to catch the faintest
sight or sound, but all in vain. The church was reached.
The mourners moved slowly up the aisle. There was not
a single heart in that large assembly which did not thrill
with sorrowful emotion. The congregation prayed in
silence, and sobs were heard in every part of the house.
The minister stood silent for a moment, then slowly and
distinctly said&mdash;&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life, saith
the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice was deep and solemn, and its clear tones
penetrated every heart. His eyes beamed with tenderness,
as he recounted with touching pathos the scenes of
past happiness and this sad reverse. He offered up petitions
to the Most High for the bereaved husband and
friends. After taking final leave of those dearly loved
features, so soon to be closed forever from our mortal
vision, we started for the cemetery, distant about a quarter
of a mile. Once more we halted. All hearts were high-strung
with the hope that Uncle Charles might yet arrive;
a prayer was said, the last sad offices were performed,
and the friends returned, with aching hearts, to their bereaved
home. Just as the family were entering the gateway,
a tired, dusty rider came galloping at full speed. He
came from the cemetery, where he had been seen to throw
himself on the newly made grave, and call, in the bitter
anguish of his soul, &ldquo;My darling, O, my darling, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
back to me.&rdquo; (His sister&rsquo;s son witnessed the scene.) It
was sad to see his manly form so bowed by sorrow. He
threw his arms around her sisters and held them in a long
embrace; then calling for the child, he clasped it to his
heart, crying, &ldquo;My Bessie&rsquo;s baby! Oh, my darling child!
You are all that is left to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cannot describe his grief. It can be better imagined,
than expressed in language.</p>


<h3>PROPHETIC CLAIRVOYANCE.</h3>

<p>Another story of my great-grandmother, which not
only exists in the family, but which I perfectly remember
to have heard from her own lips, illustrates her faculty of
what I may call prophetic clairvoyance.</p>

<p>She had a friend and neighbor, named Urie, who had
a splendid team of horses, of which he was very fond
and proud, but which she had often urged him to get rid of,
assuring him that they would cause his death if he did
not. Her habitual manifestations of this faculty were
during her somnambulic walks in the middle hours of the
night; but this I am now to relate occurred about noonday,
when she had not been asleep.</p>

<p>She was seated at a window which looked upon the road,
engaged in some work of embroidery, when she was seen
to start up, rush out to the road and run at her utmost
speed about a mile, to a spot where the grassy side of the
road sloped up to a fence. At this spot (followed by Mr.
Urie&rsquo;s wife and family), she ran up to the fence, and,
taking off her apron, was seen to hold something, seemingly
enfolded in it, with every indication of extreme
agitation and distress. With her hands clasped together
she was seen to rock her body backward and forward in
great distress over the <em>something</em> apparently covered by the
apron. Exactly one year from that day she <em>did</em> see from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
her window Mr. Urie&rsquo;s team running away wildly past the
house, dragging him entangled in the lines.</p>

<p>At the precise spot where she had stopped before, now
lay his dead body, with the bloody face so torn and disfigured
that she took off her apron to cover it up from
sight.</p>

<p>My mother used frequently to receive warning of an
approaching death in the family, through a particular
dream (it was that of dining with General Washington).
The recurrence of that dream always brought with it great
distress to her mind, and she used to say (she was the soul
of truth and all human goodness) that this warning had
never failed her.</p>

<p>Much more on this subject of these indications of ancestral
mediumship running in our family may be found in
Mr. Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Foot-falls,&rdquo; he having taken particular
interest in inquiring into the aspect of the subject.</p>


<h3>BROTHER DAVID.</h3>

<p>Besides ourselves, who have been brought so prominently
before the public, my brother David and my other sisters
have often given clear proofs of some form or degree of
mediumship. David and his wife can, at almost any time,
communicate with Spirits; not only by sitting at a table,
but by together touching a chair, or any other similar
object, the movements of which will signal to them the
letters of the alphabet.</p>


<h3>UNCLE JOHN.</h3>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s only brother, John, was once kicked on the
head by a favorite horse, which the blacksmith did not
dare to shoe, and which his young master once rashly attempted
to handle for the purpose. Uncle John was carried
into the hotel unconscious, where he lay all night in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that condition. About twelve o&rsquo;clock that night his sister,
Aunt Elizabeth (Mrs. Higgins), at home, about thirty miles
distant, both heard and saw him walk across her room,
groaning in pain. As he did not answer when she spoke
to him, she supposed he had not heard her, and she went
into her grandfather&rsquo;s room; who, speaking first before
she could do so, said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with John? He
has walked past my door several times, holding his hand
to his head, and looked into my room; but when I spoke,
he went away without answering me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning word came that he was lying, dangerously
injured, at the hotel. His father went immediately
to him, but found him unconscious and unable to speak.
He eventually recovered, and declared that he had been at
home with the family during the night of his injury.</p>

<p>His grandfather, John C. Smith, my great-grandfather,
English by birth, was the one who saved me when lost in
the woods. (See the curious story related on a future <a href="#Page_423">page</a>.)
I think he was the very noblest and grandest man I have
ever known. He was of unusual stature and strength, of
the sweetest temper and character, as well as of superior
intellect.</p>


<h3>MR. COOK&rsquo;S DEATH.</h3>

<p>A party consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Emerson, Mr. Cook&mdash;an
English gentleman and a partner and intimate friend
of Mr. Emerson&mdash;mother, her sister Catharine, Ann
Emerson and myself (we were little girls at that time),
drove to the &ldquo;Sand Hill burying-ground&rdquo; to visit the
graves of our loved ones. Mr. Cook and my aunt rode in
his carriage, while the rest of us rode in the family carriage.
They arrived a little before we did, and walked to
Mr. E&rsquo;s. plot, where stooping he pulled up a flower and,
tossing it at my beautiful Aunt Catharine, said, &ldquo;I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
who will lie here next?&rdquo; After remaining a while we
drove home, in Clinton Street, Rochester, where the nurse
was standing with the babe Georgie in her arms. (George
was an uncommonly lovely boy, named after Mr. Cook.)
When taking the child in his arms Mr. Cook said, &ldquo;O thou
angel boy! I must not neglect to will thee thy dower.&rdquo;
He remained with us through the evening and bade us
good-night. His house was nearly a mile away. I retired
with mother and her sister. I slept in a trundle-bed drawn
from under their large bed. Our family was then boarding
there, father being absent from home much of the
time. It was my habit to study my lessons in bed before
going to sleep, in which way I was sure to remember
them in the morning; and as there was to be a school exhibition
next day, it was late before I put out the candle,
when mother gave a fearful scream which brought every
one to inquire the cause. At first she declined to say anything
about it&mdash;feeling very sure it must have been Mr.
Cook she had seen; and she disliked to say anything
more. She however insisted upon having seen a man, and
described him as resting upon his hands on the bed, bending
over her sister Catharine, and looking her in the face;
she recognized the man to be Mr. Cook. They tried to
impress her with the belief that it was a dream, but she
knew she had not slept.</p>

<p>Early next morning a messenger woke up the household,
and announced that Mr. Cook had dropped dead in the
mill at 6 <span class="lower">A.M.</span> He and Mr. Emerson were the wealthy
owners of the principal flouring mills on the Genesee
River, at Rochester.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook&rsquo;s body was buried at the spot from which he
had plucked the flower.</p>

<p>Mr. Cook was no doubt sleeping quietly at the time
they were searching the house to find the apparition just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
before the midnight hour, as he said to his foreman on entering
the mill, in reply to his morning salutation, &ldquo;I am
well, and I think I slept too well, as I intended to be here
at five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; He walked a moment longer and fell, to
rise no more.</p>


<h3>STRANGE OCCURRENCES PRIOR TO GRANDFATHER&rsquo;S DEATH.</h3>

<p>My sister Maria (Mrs. Smith) from her childhood has,
at certain times, been able, by gently touching her fingers
to the lightest of tables, to make it impossible for a strong
man to lift it from the spot without danger of breaking it.</p>

<p>My sister, Mrs. Osterhout, was also remarkable for intuitive
knowledge, dreams, and visions. Some fifteen or
sixteen years ago some singular manifestations occurred
around the lingering death-bed of her husband. About a
week before his death my sister was called off to a room
in the house, five rooms distant from the one he occupied,
where some sewing women were at work, really in preparation
for his fast-nearing end. On her return he told
her he had heard all the directions she had been giving,
and repeated them to her. The following extract is from
a letter from my niece Helen, one of his children. It
speaks for itself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days afterward we were all in the room, and he
said, &lsquo;Do you see?&rsquo; We all looked in the same direction
he was looking, and saw a coffin being carried out of the
house. I shall never forget the look he gave us; Emma,
Ben, Nannie, and myself were in the room. We all saw
it. Three days before he died the boys were in the barn.
It being Sunday, we were busy doing the morning work,
when we were startled by what we thought to be the report
of a gun. A second time we heard the same report.
Father said, &lsquo;The boys have got the gun in the barn,&rsquo; and
wanted them to be called into the house; but they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
heard the second report, which they thought was in the
house, and came in to see what was the matter. We were
now all gathered in father&rsquo;s room, when a third report
sounded still louder and seemed to be in the same room
with us. Mother was very much affected, and father said,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, my darling, it is only a warning of
the near approach of my death.&rsquo; There were a great
many things at that time transpiring which were very
mysterious. Lights were seen in the house and door-yard,
barn, etc., which could not be accounted for; and sounds
were heard as of sawing, driving of nails, etc.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>MY OWN CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>All my children grew up into Spiritualism naturally.
Lillie, once, while lying awake in bed with her sister
Lizzie, the gas being at half-light, saw a lady standing in
the corner of the room who then walked about it, passed
out, and then re-entered it. She wore a dress resembling
her sister&rsquo;s wrapper, with its peculiar large flowered pattern.
The bed being a wide one, she was not in contact
with her sister, and supposed the figure to be Lizzie, and
called to her to ask what she was about, but she perceived
that it was <em>not</em> her sister, who was asleep by her side, and
whom she waked. They turned up the light, and the
figure was no more there. Both were frightened, and
kept the light burning brightly for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Lillie used often to say to me, &ldquo;Mamma, put out the
light. My guardian Spirit will take care of me.&rdquo; She
had no fear of them. Georgie, on the contrary, was somewhat
afraid, and would say, &ldquo;Leave a little light, mamma,
&rsquo;cause the Spirits are rapping.&rdquo; Leah would come flying
down-stairs, pale and almost breathless, at the least indication
of the presence of Spirits. Still they all knew and
believed in them, and loved to sit in dark circles in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
family alone and witness the different forms of manifestations.</p>

<p>Lillie has an abnormal faculty which often gives entertainment
to her friends. She goes out of the room, and
any member of the company may hide any small object
wherever he may please&mdash;such as a key or coin or anything
convenient. All the rest of the company are requested to
fix their thoughts on the object and its place of concealment,
while careful not to do or say anything to suggest
a clue. On her entrance she takes his hand and applies it
to her forehead, still holding on to it and keeping her eyes
shut. She will then lead him to the spot where it is concealed.
She moves by starts, he accompanying her passively.
She very rarely fails to find the article concealed.</p>


<h3>MUSICAL MEDIUMSHIP.</h3>

<p>I might tell much of the indications of the mediumistic
character which have run through the children of the generation
following our own; that is to say, those of my
brother and sisters and myself, including my nephew&rsquo;s
little son of five years, who plays on a child&rsquo;s harmonica
with astonishing accuracy and beauty, accompanying any
musical performance and following every variation with
whatever rapidity, with his face kindled with excitement
and delight; the whole being spontaneous, without ever
having had any instruction. He is (I have no doubt) a
musical medium, of whom the world has seen several;
the most remarkable one being the idiot boy known as
&ldquo;Blind Tom.&rdquo; It is indeed evident enough that this
mysterious gift, or whatever it may be called, is not destined
to die out with the present generation.</p>

<p>The next instance of mediumship in the generation succeeding
ourselves is such as to merit a chapter to itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">MEDIUMISTIC VEIN IN OUR FAMILY (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>


<h3>MARVELLOUS WRITING BY A BABY MEDIUM.</h3>

<p>But I must mention more particularly the case of my
little nephew, the elder of the two children of my sister
Katie, now Mrs. Jencken (pronounced Yencken); for I
have now before me two pieces of writing actually executed
by his baby fingers. The story of the incident is as follows:</p>

<p>Katie and I were sitting at the billiard table, which then
occupied the middle of our library, with the child in my
lap; while his mother, at my side, was relating some of
the incidents of the day. (She had been calling on old
friends.) The child being troublesome in his movements
and cries, his mother, to quiet him, gave him the paper
and pencil (it was a piece of white blotting paper, not
much inked by use), as the child was fond of scratching
lines and marks. She said, &ldquo;There! take that, and keep
still.&rdquo; He dropped the paper once or twice, and I picked it
up and held one end of it, he holding the other; and with
his disengaged hand I noticed that he was not making
mere marks and scratches, but that he was actually forming
letters, and I exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, Katie, he is writing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; was her answer. We watched
the process, as his dear little fingers were guided to complete,
in somewhat straggling letters, though perfectly distinct,
&ldquo;Grandma is here. Boysie.&rdquo; It is not strong nor
dark enough to be reproduced in photography, but any respectable
inquirer is welcome to inspection of the sentence
written by the child, then one year old. His father had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
been delighted, at his birth, with the appearance of so
beautiful a child; and his baptismal name was Ferdinand
Lowenstein Diedrick. His pet name was &ldquo;Boysie.&rdquo; The
extent of his baby vocabulary at that time was &ldquo;papa&rdquo;
and &ldquo;mamma.&rdquo; My late brother-in-law, Mr. Jencken, was
a highly respected barrister in London. He was prominent
in the labors of the &ldquo;Society for the Codification of
International Law,&rdquo; of which the well-known David Dudley
Field is President; who has said of him that not half
a dozen men in all Europe could compete with him.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned writing actually executed
by this wonderful medium baby of about a year old, which
I have in my possession, and of which I regret that it cannot
be photographed, I have before me also a photographic
copy, of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte de visite</i> size (sent me by Mr. Jencken), of a
piece of writing executed by his infant fingers at the age
of five months and eighteen days (of course controlled by
Spirit power), in these words: <i>I love this little boy. God
bless his mama. J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;F.</i> And below, <i>I am happy</i> (the last
syllable of &ldquo;happy&rdquo; being scrawled very indistinctly).
Below it is the following attestation by Mr. Jencken&rsquo;s
hand: &ldquo;Written by the infant boy of Mrs. Jencken on
the 11th March, 1874, aged five months and eighteen days.
Mr. Jencken, Mrs. Jencken, and nurse present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the rear of the card, in the hand of Mr. Jencken
(and in that of my sister, Katie, for her signature), is the
further attestation: &ldquo;The writing on the other side of
this leaf was written by our infant child, aged five months
and eighteen days, in our presence, in a clear light, the
pencil having been placed in the baby&rsquo;s hand by an invisible
agency.&mdash;London, 11th March, 1874. (Signed) H.
D. Jencken. (Signed) K.&nbsp;F. Jencken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the opposite page will be found lithographic copies of
the two sides of the card above described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Among my loose papers I find a newspaper article from
the <cite>London Spiritualist</cite> of December 12, 1873, respecting
this extraordinary child:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mediumship of a Baby.</span>&mdash;H.&nbsp;D. Jencken, Barrister-at-Law,
of 53 Brompton-Crescent, Brompton, has had further
disturbances in his house, in consequence of the mediumship
of his little boy, aged two months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last Friday Mr. Jencken and Mrs. Jencken (Kate Fox)
went to the great scientific <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> at the Crystal Palace,
and that same evening, about nine o&rsquo;clock, their housemaid,
Elizabeth, went up-stairs to the front drawing-room
to turn down the gas burners. As she approached the
door she saw its handle turn round and she cried out,
&lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; The door then opened, and a veiled
figure looked out at her. She only saw a part of the face,
because the white drapery about it hid the rest, and she
fancied that the eyes had an evil look. She ran down-stairs
and gave the alarm to the cook and sempstress, saying
that she thought thieves were in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just after this occurred on the first floor, the nurse,
Mrs. Macarthy, who was watching the baby in a room
near the top of the house, heard footsteps outside; the
door gently opened, and a short woman, young and pleasant-looking,
robed in white, entered, and returned quickly,
twice. At first the nurse thought that a joke was being
played upon her; but, upon searching the adjoining room
and landing, she could not find anybody. She then went
down-stairs and joined the three servants below, who had
previously heard footsteps going up-stairs from the drawing-room
to the nursery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook then went for a policeman, and the other three
servants went up to the nursery, where they heard rapping
noises and voices; the latter were not sufficiently distinct
to be intelligible. They also heard footsteps going right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
up to the top of the house. When the police arrived they
searched the house and found nothing. Just as they were
going away, some footsteps followed them down the stairs.
One of the policemen turned round and said that the
noises must be caused by a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three days previously the housemaid had seen a figure
in the drawing-room. It suddenly disappeared. This
form, she said, was covered with a shawl, like that worn
by Mrs. Jencken before she left the house. Was it Mrs.
Jencken&rsquo;s &lsquo;double,&rsquo; present there in consequence of her
constant thoughts about the baby?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nurse says she has seen hands making passes over
the baby, and has heard raps at the head of the child&rsquo;s
bedstead, and once the pillow was pressed down by an
unseen hand. On another occasion, a gold ring was seen
knocking against the iron rail at the head of the bedstead.
Last Sunday we questioned the nurse and housemaid on
all these points. They were in a very nervous state about
the whole matter, and evidently deeply impressed by the
circumstances, since they knew nothing about Spiritualism,
until these phenomena forced themselves upon their attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jencken tells us that a few days ago, about six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, while it was yet dark, Mrs. Jencken
brought the child to him. A strong light streamed
from both the eyes of the baby, and illuminated its face,
and raps said, &lsquo;We are looking at you through the eyes
of the baby.&rsquo; When Mr. Jencken stated this, we called
his attention to the circumstance that a similar thing had
occurred in connection with the mediumship of Swedenborg,
whose eyes shone for a time with such lustre, as to
frighten some persons who unexpectedly entered his room.
In that case also, the Spirits said that they were looking
through his eyes. On several occasions recently, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
we have been present at <em>séances</em> at Mr. Jencken&rsquo;s house,
footsteps have been heard outside, and the rustling of a
dress against the door. On quickly opening the door, nobody
was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Jencken leave town for Brighton next
Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a further specimen of Spirit writing executed by the
fingers of this marvellous infant, the reader is referred to
page 550 of Mrs. E. Hardinge Britten&rsquo;s recent great work,
entitled &ldquo;Nineteenth Century Miracles.&rdquo; The writing in
this case was, &ldquo;<i>I love this little child God bless him advise
his father to go back to London on Monday by all means.
Susan.</i>&rdquo; The attesting witnesses are, I. Wason, K.&nbsp;F.
Jencken, E. Buffum, New Church College, Devonshire
Street, Islington, London, and the + mark of Mrs. McCarthy,
the nurse who held the child.</p>

<p>From a letter from Mr. Jencken I know that this advice
to him &ldquo;<i>to go back to London on Monday by all means</i>&rdquo; was
good counsel. It proved that his presence there was necessary
for important business. Mrs. Britten&rsquo;s book (p.
550) gives a facsimile of this communication as written by
Spirit power through the tiny fingers of a baby. My
sister wrote me at the time a long letter about it, full of
anxiety lest so wonderful a child could not be expected to
grow up to health. Its correctness is therefore unimpeachable.
But I must add that the letter-press at the bottom,
in which the age of the infant is given as &ldquo;nine days,&rdquo; is
a manifest mistake, probably typographical. It is quite
sufficient that his age counted by months. As a human
achievement by such baby fingers, it would be incredible;
as the act of a Spirit employing those of a remarkable baby
medium, it is simple enough to the apprehension of any
experienced Spiritualist.</p>

<p>What future awaits this child remains to be seen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
house of his parents used for a time to be overrun by people
of rank too high to be (in that country) refused admittance,
who wanted to see some specimens of his mediumistic
manifestations; until his parents wisely determined
to break it all off, and not allow any exercise of his powers
in that line to be indulged in, till he shall have reached the
age of adult physical development in health and strength.</p>

<p>The child is now about ten years of age, and, I rejoice
to say, healthy, active, and bright, as well as beautiful;&mdash;and
further that his parents have kept him entirely aloof
from mediumship&mdash;to which course I strongly advised
them.</p>


<h3>OUR MOTHER AND FATHER.</h3>

<p>Our dear mother (who passed from this life to the next
on the 3d August, 1865) was a woman of sound intellect,
gentle disposition, very charitable, and just to every one.
She had great power of discrimination, and seldom failed
in her estimate of character. Her portrait looks down
upon me from our parlor wall; and when I look up into
her blessed face, my first impulse is to fall upon my knees
and thank my God that I have had such a mother.</p>

<p>Robert Dale Owen was one day sitting in the back parlor,
engaged in writing. He remained with us three
months, at my husband&rsquo;s invitation, while writing his
&ldquo;Foot-falls on the Boundary of Another World.&rdquo; He sat
at equal distance from mother and her portrait, alternately
looking from one to the other. As I stepped in the door,
he turned to me and said, &ldquo;Mrs. Underhill, if that were
the portrait of my mother, and she were living, as yours
now is, and could sit for another every day, I would not
take a thousand dollars for it. I never saw a portrait so
perfectly correct in my life, and I doubt if you could ever
get another so perfect.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Our father was not as well known to the public. Situated
as we were, our parents concluded that, as we were
compelled to travel and submit to all investigations
necessary to establish a new truth (for new it was, to us),
or to submit to, or rest under the condemnation of the
world at large, we must of necessity have suitable companions.
Therefore it was decided that mother and Calvin
should go wherever we went.</p>

<p>Our father was a member of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, and was a class leader at the time of his death (on
the 10th January, 1865). One Sunday morning he was
ready to go to church and stood in the library, waiting for
my husband, who was going with him. I stood beside him
when suddenly the signal for the alphabet was given. I
repeated the letters, and the Spirit said, &ldquo;My dear son,
it is a pleasure to me to attend you to the church. I always
go with you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His chest heaved, and with tears in his eyes he said,
&ldquo;Are you the Spirit of my dear mother now speaking to
me?&rdquo; The answer was, &ldquo;Yes, I am your mother Catharine.&rdquo;
He then asked, &ldquo;Is my father here too?&rdquo; Answer,
&ldquo;Yes, my dear son. I bless you this morning. We shall
all be together in Heaven soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">David.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cl">I asked him, &ldquo;Do you think the Methodists would
approve of this if you were to read it to them?&rdquo; He replied,
&ldquo;It would matter little to me whether they did or
not. I not only believe it but I know it is true, and the
time will come when they will all believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Underhill then went with him to church, and when
they returned he said to me (holding up the little message
in his hand), &ldquo;This, to me, is far stronger proof of a
glorious immortality than all the preachers on earth could
give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother was also a member of the same church in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Rochester in 1849. She was officially waited upon in Arcadia
by a very young preacher (hardly twenty years of age
in appearance) who had, evidently, but little experience in
the office to which he had been <em>specially called</em> to save
souls. He introduced himself as the &ldquo;servant of the Lord,&rdquo;
and, walking up to mother, said, &ldquo;This is sister Fox, I
suppose?&rdquo; Mother replied, &ldquo;I am Mrs. Fox.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
Mrs. Fox, there is a complaint against you for countenancing
your children in carrying on a wicked deception.
It is calculated to do much harm, and it is contrary to the
religion of the Bible.&rdquo; He urged her to make her confession
before the church, and cause her children to discontinue
their unholy pursuit, and she could remain in good
standing in the church. This little man was a circuit
preacher, and we suppose had taken upon himself to do
the Lord&rsquo;s work, in his own way, as we never heard from
him again; and I seriously doubt if any one ever sent him.
It recalls what Sojourner Truth said to the preacher, when
she was attending a woman&rsquo;s rights meeting in the church
and a violent thunder-storm came up, with peal after peal
shaking the building to its foundation, when the minister
arose and proposed that they should adjourn, as he thought
the Lord was angry on account of the movement, and he
believed it was wicked to hold such a meeting in a church.</p>

<p>Sojourner arose and said to him, &ldquo;Set still, chile. Don&rsquo;t
you be afeared. I don&rsquo; believe the Lord ever hearn tell
on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother was never expelled from the church, but the
leading members came to our side&mdash;minister and all.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>A celebrated seer has publicly asserted that rapping
mediums are necessarily of nervous temperament, apprehensive
of evil, and usually diseased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>There has never been in our family, so far as I have
been able to trace them, on either side, a taint of disease;
from my mother&rsquo;s grandfather Rutan, who lived to be
ninety-three years of age, and her grandfather on her
father&rsquo;s side, John C. Smith, who was more than eighty
years of age when he left this sphere of existence. The
same is true of my father&rsquo;s father and grandfather,
neither of whom were diseased. We have been singularly
free from all manner of ailments so common in thousands
of families. We had no taint of hereditary scrofula,
were never subject to inflammatory diseases. Healthy,
sound, and strong, not easily frightened, steadfast in faith,
and never disposed to believe anything without evidence.
I have very little interest in anything covered by the
words theoretic speculations, or in self-induced conditions,
in which many thousands who stand on rostrums and teach
the anxious inquirers after truth that of which they themselves
know little or nothing. My motto is: Live up to
your highest light. Listen to the small voice within, and
obey the dictates of your conscience. Do unto others as
you would be done by. Follow the golden rule. Go worship
where and what your conscience, not pride, leads you,
and you need not fear to meet your God.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Justice as well as reverential duty has prompted my
gracing the title-page with the portrait of my mother,
rather than follow the customary practice of placing upon
it that of the author, by way of personal introduction to
the eye of the reader. Though, as has been seen, our
father had but little part to play beyond that of consenting
spectator in the early history of Spiritualism, yet my
mother&rsquo;s part in it, and services to its cause, were of the
highest value and importance. Her strength, moral and
mental, as the central figure of our family group before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the public, largely supported us in our mission, in which
she always accompanied and protected us; nor, after she
had once yielded her consent and acceptance of the &ldquo;duty,&rdquo;
did she ever begrudge her time and her labors thus withdrawn
from the private life of domesticity, which would
have been infinitely her preference.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ROCHESTER (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">&ldquo;Repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo;&mdash;First Money Accepted&mdash;Muscular
Quakerism&mdash;Letter from George Willets&mdash;Letter
from John E. Robinson&mdash;Caution against Consultation of
Spirits about Worldly Interests.</p>


<p>To resume the narrative interrupted at page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>.</p>

<p>We left Corinthian Hall about ten o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span>, and returned
with Mr. and Mrs. Post, to their hospitable Quaker
home.</p>

<p>We had passed the fiery ordeal. It had been a wearisome,
exhausting trial. We needed rest, and it was thought
advisable for us to remain there a few days. Many people
called at our house on Troup Street, and, when they were
informed of our absence, subsequently called at Mr. Post&rsquo;s
to see us, but were refused admittance under the circumstances
which imposed the necessity.</p>

<p>Before we left this home of our kind and dear friends,
mother and Kathie returned. (The latter had been to
Mr. Capron&rsquo;s, in Auburn, and returned with mother to
Rochester.)</p>

<p>Mother had not heard of the public investigation, and
thus was spared all the anxiety and torture of mind which
we had undergone. She declared that if she had been
there she would not have permitted it.</p>

<p>We were consoled by the reflection that we had fairly
gained the victory, and cleared ourselves from the charges
of deception; and that was our first and chief desire.
We believed we had done our duty, and rejoiced that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
had been so truly, so kindly and so nobly supported, and
so honorably acquitted. Mother was rejoiced at our success
and began to feel more resigned. Many persons
continued to call, and all were anxious to learn from us
and the Spirits something more than they were able to
get through popular report or the newspapers. We often
refused to see them, and declared we would not again
subject ourselves to the criticisms of those who knew little
or nothing of the subject, and were in general so bitterly
hostile and prejudiced against it.</p>

<p>Oh, how little did we know of all that was before us!
We had just opened the door to the public curiosity and
interest; and it was not for us to discriminate <em>who</em> should
enter therein. The people came from every direction.
We knew not what to do. Judge Hascall came to spend
an evening with us, bringing with him a large party of
his friends, viz., Judge Summerfield, Hon. J. Hedden,
Andrew Stewart, Mr. Duncan McNaughton, Judge Chamberlain,
Mr. McKay, and Mr. McVean. One of these parties
was known to his friends as an extreme infidel in
religious matters.</p>

<p>Several of the parties named had visited us before, and
they had urged Mr. McNaughton to spend the evening
with us. He tried to excuse himself, but they insisted,
and he finally consented to do so; they clearly understood
that he was not to take any part in the investigation.
They arrived at about eight o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span> Judge Hascall
introduced the gentlemen as his friends and neighbors
from Genesee County, N.&nbsp;Y. They were all distinguished
men, holding high positions in their several pursuits.</p>

<p>No sooner had we taken our seats at the table, than the
Spirits spelled out, &ldquo;My dear son, repeat the Lord&rsquo;s
prayer.&rdquo; Each member looked at the others inquiringly,
but no word was spoken except to ask &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The rappings answered, &ldquo;My dear son, ha&rsquo;e ye forgotten
your puir auld mither? O my son, repeat the
Lord&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo; Mr. McNaughton was a very tall man,
with a strong Scotch accent. The rapping still continued
to call upon him to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s prayer. He looked
from one to another, but said nothing. His friends urged
him to comply with the Spirit&rsquo;s request; but he was disgusted,
and thought it was a trick which his friends were
playing upon him, and as they were very jolly, he would
not make himself ridiculous by resenting it: but still no
further manifestations came, under the then state of
things.</p>

<p>His friends told him that if he wanted to witness anything
further he would have to comply with the request
of the Spirit. After much persuasion, he reluctantly commenced
in a very low, indistinct manner to mumble something
that sounded like &ldquo;Our father, which art in heaven.&rdquo;
By this time a universal roar of laughter broke from the
company. Still, the Spirit urged him to go on, and he
began again with little better success.</p>

<p>His friends knew full well it had been many a day since
he had prayed with his &ldquo;dear auld mither.&rdquo; The Spirit
then spelled that &ldquo;<em>all</em> should join in repeating the Lord&rsquo;s
prayer,&rdquo; and we all united in its repetition. The responsive
rappings of approval were heard all over the room&mdash;on
the table, chairs, floor, and wall. Mr. McNaughton
looked astonished. The table danced with evident joy,
and we were obliged to move back. There it stood, upon
one foot, fairly dancing. Mr. McNaughton exclaimed
boldly, in his Scotch dialect, &ldquo;Exthraordinary! Exthraordinary!
I begin to understand it now.&rdquo; The laughter
was over. The Spirit of his mother said, &ldquo;My dear son,
do you remember how we used to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s prayer
together, when you were a little laddie?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Yes, I comprehend it all. I am converted to the truth of
Spiritual manifestations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company remained until ten o&rsquo;clock, and the manifestations
were very satisfactory. They felt more than
gratified, and, to use their own words, said, &ldquo;We cannot
go away without giving you some remuneration for the
time you have kindly spent with us.&rdquo; Mr. McNaughton
had just lost a lovely daughter, and she gave him sweet
assurance of her undying love and her immortal existence.</p>

<p>This is the first instance in which we had ever been offered
payment for our time. They offered it in kindness
and good faith, believing it was justly our due. But to us
it seemed humiliating. We had not needed such aid, as
my brother furnished us with provisions from the farm,
and, with what I still had left of that received for teaching,
I had enough for present purposes; and I fully intended
to return with mother, and live at the old home. Still
our friends insisted that we should not refuse their kindly
intended gift. This first money was received on November
28, 1849.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>I will here introduce, for love and veneration to his
memory, a letter written about this time by our excellent
Quaker friend George Willets, of Rochester, to Mr. E.&nbsp;W.
Capron, who handed it over to me. He was one of the
noblest of men. And Quaker as he was (he was one of
the &ldquo;Progressive Friends,&rdquo; commonly called Hicksites), I
once witnessed a scene in which a just and righteous indignation
caused him to cast off his coat, in readiness to
deal in very mundane fashion with an unworthy and misbehaving
member of one of the &ldquo;investigating committees.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never fought a man in my life,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I will not stand by and see thee insult these children.&rdquo;
The assailant wilted down. The provocation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
such that I am sure the angel who may have charge of the
short record of Quaker sins, after writing it &ldquo;dropped a
tear on the words and blotted them out forever.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM GEORGE WILLETS.</h3>

<p class="center">(About end of 1848.)</p>

<p><i>Dear friend, E.&nbsp;W. Capron:</i><br /></p>

<p>It is with some reluctance that I furnish you with the
following statement. Not that I am afraid to tell the
truth, but that the world, as I conceive, is not ready to
receive such truths yet. <em>Ridicule</em> will probably be heaped
upon me; but when I consider that it is the ignorant only
who use that weapon, perhaps I can afford to stand up and
say, &ldquo;Let the storm come.&rdquo; All who know me can say
whether I have been truthful from my youth up, yea or
nay; and the strongest language that I can use is to say
that the following statement is <em>strictly and entirely true</em>.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1848, I had concluded, from the best
judgment that I could bring to my aid, that it was best for
my family to remove somewhere among the wilds of the
West. Accordingly I took a tour of observation, and finding
some land in Michigan, that suited me better than any
other, belonging to a gentleman living in Rochester, I
stopped on my return, in order, if possible, to negotiate
for it. I stayed with my friend and relative, Isaac Post,
and while there he told me of certain sounds being heard
in the city; and that they displayed intelligence, and purported
to be made by &ldquo;Spirits,&rdquo; or persons invisible to us.
I was really sceptical about any such things, but at his
solicitation went to examine the matter. The persons with
whom these sounds seemed to be, I had never seen nor
heard of before, and my friend was careful not to tell them
who I was, or where I had been. It seems that the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was asked whether there was any communication for
me, and the direction from the sounds was, that three persons
be magnetized; two of whom were present, and one
was sent for from a neighboring family. I did not know
the name of any person present, and I was also certain
that none of them knew me. After the three persons were
put in the clairvoyant state, one of them said, &ldquo;We have
got to go to Michigan.&rdquo; They all agreed that they had
got to go there, and on my account. They did seem all to
go there, and began to describe places and things which I
had seen, and at length came to a piece of land which they
said was the place they came to look at. They then described
the land so accurately, which I had stopped in
Rochester to buy, that I began to wonder who had told
them. They all, with one accord, then said, &ldquo;But he
must not go there. His father says that he had better not
go.&rdquo; As they said this, there came a loud sound close to
my chair, and <em>I sat some distance from any other person</em>.
They spoke much of my father, and what his mind was,
and at each time that same sound was heard. Up to this
time I had not spoken a word, but found the big drops of
perspiration starting from my face. I gathered courage,
and thought I would dispel that illusion directly. I said,
&ldquo;As you assume to know my father, and what his mind is
concerning me, <em>perhaps</em> you can tell his name.&rdquo; They all
seemed to look steadily for some time, then commenced
and spoke slowly and deliberately these letters: &ldquo;W-i-l-l-i-a-m
W-i-l-l-e-t-s.&rdquo; At each letter the loud sound that
I first heard was again heard, and felt immediately under
my feet. I never was so astonished in my life, and involuntarily
said, &ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; The sounds
then said, by the alphabet being called over, that they had
better be awakened, and the first loud sounds said, &ldquo;I will
talk with George, and tell him all about it.&rdquo; The direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was for Mr. Post, myself, and a little girl, thirteen
years old, to go by ourselves. And here I wish it distinctly
understood, that all which I shall relate as obtained from
those sounds, was in the presence only of my friends, Mr.
and Mrs. Post, myself, and the little girl spoken of. As
what follows all purported to be from my father, I will
say that his name was William Willets, a member of the
Society of Friends, widely known at Westbury, Long
Island, where he lived until nearly sixty years of age, and
subsequently at Skaneateles, Onondaga County, where he
died in 1841. The communication by sounds then went
on to say that it was my father who was present and talking
with me; and three hours were consumed at the first
interview.</p>

<p>In saying to me what his counsel was, it always assumed
to counsel and advise, but never to dictate. He said that
it was not best for us to go to Michigan, and gave various
reasons, among which were that we should not enjoy ourselves
in a new country, and that my health would not be
competent for the task of clearing up new land; and that
he <em>foresaw</em>, if we did go, that we should come back again,
and would be less in number than when we went. I then
asked what was best to do. The answer then was, &ldquo;Come
to Rochester.&rdquo; I replied that I knew of no business that
I could do in Rochester. The sounds said, &ldquo;I will tell thee
when thee comes.&rdquo; I asked if I might know now. The
answer was, &ldquo;No, no business is needed until thee comes,
and then I will tell thee.&rdquo; The sounds then said, that after
a time it would be best for me to buy some land. I asked
where. The sounds then spelled out the name of a man
whom no one present knew, and said that he owned fifty
acres of land on such a street adjoining the city, and such a
distance from the centre of the city; that he would sell
any part. I asked the price that would be asked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sounds were heard and counted by three of us,&mdash;one hundred
and fifty times in succession,&mdash;to tell us the number
of dollars per acre that would be asked. The sounds said
that we had better go the next day and see if this was so,
and said that we should not see the man until ten o&rsquo;clock,
though we might look for him as early as we pleased.</p>

<p>In the morning I looked in the Directory and there
found the name spelled out to us, and went to his residence
at seven o&rsquo;clock, and was informed that he was gone to a
distant part of the city, and would not be home until
twelve o&rsquo;clock. We then went to find him, and had some
difficulty in doing so, but after talking with him five or
six minutes, looked at the time, and it <em>was seven minutes
past ten</em>. This person said that he owned fifty acres on
the street told us by the sounds, and that he would sell
any part. When I asked him the price, he showed me a
map with the price of each lot marked, and taking the
number of acres said by the sounds to be best to buy, and
averaging the price, it was the price told us by the sounds,
within six one-hundredths of a dollar per acre. I then went
home to my family and pondered over these strange things.
Many were the conflicts in my own mind, and I heard
the cry from all quarters of &ldquo;humbug,&rdquo; &ldquo;deception,&rdquo;
&ldquo;fraud;&rdquo; but I could not believe that I wanted to deceive
myself. Three months I thought of these things deeply,
and <em>I could not go</em> to Michigan. I concluded, if it was
deception, it would do the world some good to find it out.
The first of December, 1848, I moved from Waterloo to
Rochester. A few days after getting here, the little girl
spoken of came round to our house, and said that the
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; had directed her to come; for what purpose she
did not know; we inquired what it was, and this was the
communication: &ldquo;I told thee if thee would come to
Rochester, I would tell thee where thee could find employment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in four days from this time I will tell thee. In
the meantime the anti-slavery folks are going to hold their
fair; would it not be well for thee to help them?&rdquo; No
one was present at this time except my wife, the little
girl, and myself. The four days went by, and again, without
solicitation, and without thinking the time was up, the
girl came again. The communication was, &ldquo;Apply to
William Wiley, Superintendent of the Auburn and Rochester
Railroad, to-morrow at two o&rsquo;clock, at his office,
for a situation, and thee will have one before this week is
out.&rdquo; This was Thursday. I was a stranger to Mr. Wiley,
and I called on Mr. Post, and told him the direction, and
asked him if the next day he would go with me. That
evening he, happening to be at the depot, inquired if Mr.
Wiley was at home, and was told that he was in Boston,
and, by a letter just received, would not be at home till Friday
night. I was told by the sounds on Wednesday to
apply on Thursday at two o&rsquo;clock. Thursday at half-past
one, instead of going to the railroad office, I went round
where these sounds were heard, and said, &ldquo;How is this?&mdash;I
am told to apply to William Wiley, and he is in Boston.&rdquo;
The sounds said: &ldquo;<i>Go to his office now, he is there.</i>&rdquo; I
called for Mr. Post and walked immediately there, and
<em>found Mr. Wiley in his office</em>. He said that he had returned
sooner than he expected to when he wrote the letter.
Mr. Post said that I was a relative of his, and wished employment;
and Mr. Wiley replied that they were all full,
with abundant applications, and could give no encouragement
whatever. We walked back, thinking deeply, and I
went where the sounds were heard again. I inquired,
&ldquo;How is this?&mdash;Mr. Wiley has no place for me!&rdquo; The
answer was: &ldquo;<i>Thee will have a place on the cars, and will
know it before the week is out.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Saturday night, at dark, I met Mr. Post, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
asked if I had heard anything from Mr. Wiley. I replied,
&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo; At eight o&rsquo;clock on that same evening Mr.
Post called at my house, and said that Mr. Wiley had just
been at his store, and said that he had a place for me, and
wished me to call at his office on Monday morning. As
Mr. Wiley did not tell what place I was to fill, I again
asked the sounds what it was; and they said it was to go
as baggage-master between this place and Auburn. On
Sunday morning I wrote to my friend James Truman, of
Waterloo, stating that I should pass through that place on
Monday following, in the capacity above stated, <em>before I
knew from Mr. Wiley what place he wanted me to fill</em>;
and he can probably testify to that fact. One month
after I had been running on the cars, I learned that the
person whose place I took had done things worthy of a
dismissal, <em>previous</em> to my being directed to make application,
which did not come to Mr. Wiley&rsquo;s notice till <em>the
day on which I received the appointment</em>. These things
have only been known to a few friends; you and the
world now have them. I have many communications,
penned down at the time they were received, purporting
to be from my father, all of the most elevating character,
inciting me to goodness, purity and honesty of heart, and
ever pointing to the endless progression of man. In conclusion,
I may say that I have examined the matter attentively
for one year and a half, and have had abundant opportunities
to do so, and am prepared to say, although the
sounds may cease to-day, and never be heard again, <em>they
have displayed a remarkable degree of intelligence, and
were not made by any person visible</em> to us.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">George Willets.</span><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span><br /></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<p>Before proceeding further I desire at this point to insert
in this volume an interesting letter, addressed to the Rochester
<cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, by our friend Mr. John E. Robinson,
also, like Mr. Willets, a well-known and distinguished
member of the Society of Friends.</p>

<p>The controversy on the rapping and the general spiritual
manifestations after the public investigation could no
longer be suppressed. It became a subject which elicited
much comment in the public prints; but in relation to
which the Spiritualists had nothing to fear. Their opponents,
generally, wrote without ever having examined it;
and graded the vehemence of their opposition by the
strength of their fealty to the teachings of their leaders.
One of these acknowledged leaders was Chester Dewey,
D.D., of the Rochester Collegiate Institute, who, without
seeking to investigate the subject, claimed to recognize it
as a fraud in its inception and wicked in its designs; and
thus recorded his opinion in the public press at Rochester.
His letters to the Rochester <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, at the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
drew forth the following rejoinder by Mr. Robinson, of
that city, which was published in the columns of that
paper:</p>


<h3>&ldquo;THE RAPPING MYSTERY.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Messrs. Editors</span>: There has been a vast deal of ink
shed upon the above-named subject, and much of it to
but little purpose, except to demonstrate the willingness
of individuals to show up before the world the least attractive
features of their intellectual and moral characters.
Far the greater number of paragraphists who have essayed
to enlighten the world on this subject, and protect this
community in particular from <em>humbug</em>, as they are pleased
to term it, have made up their various articles of exceedingly
cheap material. Ridicule, the fool&rsquo;s argument, has
formed the chief staple of their lucubrations. Denunciation,
unsparingly poured out, has been heaped upon the
heads of those most immediately connected with this singular
phenomenon, and an unwarrantable and unmanly
meanness, which has led the writers, almost without exception,
to traduce the character of the Fox family, and
has taught us how easy it is for men to forget their manhood
and stoop to a point at which they can lay claim to
but little of the nobility of human nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, for one, can find an apology for the penny-a-liners
who have poured their puerile effusions <em>at</em> the knocking
mystery. They do but cater for a public sentiment and
public ignorance in this matter; and their bread-and-butter
demands of them that they shall not wave their inky
wands beyond the line of that opinion. But there are
some for whom we cannot make this apology. I notice
in your paper of 23d inst. a communication over the signature
of C.&nbsp;D. The writer of said article lays claim
(and not a groundless one) to the reputation of a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
wisdom. He is known among us as the expounder of
laws natural and divine. His picture, so he tells us, hangs
from the walls of the Athenæum, and looks down complacently
upon its visitors as a teacher of the exact and
occult sciences. The community in which he lives has
nourished him during a long lapse of years, has accredited
to him the prerogatives he has claimed, and has looked
up to him, as one clothed with authority, to enlighten it
upon all abstruse subjects. And yet, with the knowledge
(which he must possess) that if anything be spoken of it
must be spoken of understandingly,&mdash;that a man in his position
utterly disregards the safety of his reputation who
rushes to record an opinion without ascertaining that it is
tenable, and that he has facts to sustain him; this self-same
C.&nbsp;D., this Solon of the closet and pulpit, without a particle
of evidence, in the absence of all personal observation,
rushes in the hot haste of blind folly to the press, and tells
the &ldquo;good people&rdquo; that the phenomenon in question is no
phenomenon at all, but only a sheer humbug! a miserable
delusion, cunningly contrived, but fit only to deceive such
fanatical fools as have been chasing shadows from time immemorial,
down to the advent of Mormonism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This word <em>humbug</em> is in great request. It is of modern
origin, and the moderns are making the most of it. Everything
new, while going through its incipient stage, is denominated
&lsquo;humbug.&rsquo; Everything and everybody a whit in
advance of the age or its intelligence is looked at askance
by the gaping crowd, and &lsquo;humbug&rsquo; is the ready watchword.
The community&rsquo;s acknowledged leaders, and whose
antics, at times, should have taught them that</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A little learning is a dangerous thing,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>are asked by their too credulous disciples to give them their
opinion on some new and startling development in physics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
or man&rsquo;s intellectual nature, and immediately these
&lsquo;learned Thebans,&rsquo; scorning the patient toil and honest
purpose of the true student, turn their blear eyes upon the
interrogations and shout Humbug! Humbug!</p>

<p>&ldquo;In such cases their visual organs are of about as much
service to them as the sun is to that burrowing animal
which shuns the light of day. When will men, even
whose gray hairs seem to ask us to expect better things of
them, learn that bareface assertion weighs not as evidence
with those who choose to think for themselves? Ours is
a thinking age, and requires something more than the bold
<em>say so</em> of any man to convince people that a thing <em>may</em> or
<em>may not</em> be. We live at a period, too, and in the midst of
minds which have learned that much that was received as
unadulterated truth by the past, upon which the dust of
buried centuries had gathered and seemed to hallow, has
been proved erroneous by the light of advancing knowledge
and the searching analysis of science. And who shall
say where that knowledge is to stop? Is there to be no new
unfolding of man&rsquo;s intellectual powers? Is he ever to remain
in the comparative ignorance he now is in respecting
the relations which he, while here in this life, sustains to
the spiritual world? Are the laws of his being and its attributes
as yet entirely revealed to him? Is the physical
of this world of so much importance that the astounding
developments of this and the coming cycles of time are to
be confined entirely to that, to the exclusion of man&rsquo;s
higher and more ethereal nature? These questions I leave
your correspondent C.&nbsp;D. and his coadjutor J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. to
answer for themselves in their more reflective hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;C.&nbsp;D. says &lsquo;the wary and eagle-eyed are kept out, and
excluded from opportunity of investigation.&rsquo; Now, to be
perfectly plain, this remark borders very much upon misrepresentation.
<em>It is not so.</em> And if the gentleman would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
have &lsquo;the good people&rsquo; understand that he is thus denied,
I would undeceive them. Mr. Dewey has on more than
one occasion been urged by those who would have afforded
him every opportunity for investigation, to test the reality
of the said phenomena. He could have had, and may
have, associated with him in such investigation, men whom
he or others may select, as his equals in every respect, to
aid him; and before he has the temerity to repeat his
uttered cry of humbug, and brand again, with most unchristian
readiness, as deceivers, individuals whom he does
not know, I call upon him to avail himself of the senses
which God has given him for that purpose. He need feel
no repugnance to visiting so obscure a locality as Troup
Street. His equals (to say the least) have been there before
him, and he would not have to tarry long in that region
to meet with visitors who possess more intelligence, a wider
charity, greater modesty, and a better purpose than he has
manifested in his communications.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s practice is the touchstone of his faith, and I
want no better evidence of the practical infidelity of any
one, than to know that while he preaches for so much the
square yard the doctrine of an after-life, he scouts anything
which comes to us in the shape of tangible evidence
of the soul&rsquo;s immortality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dewey says he will be &lsquo;glad to see the truth advanced,
lead where it may.&rsquo; In this I join him, and such
motive must be my apology for trespassing upon your
columns and patience.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Respectfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;John E. Robinson.</span><br />

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I feel bound to call attention to the fact that the directions narrated
in this letter were <em>volunteered</em> by the Spirits to Mr. Willets, not sought by
him, and they were all strictly correct. They led to this good and serviceable
friend being established in Rochester, where he became very useful
to us and to the nascent Cause to which the Spirits had called and devoted
us. But I am anxious to caution the reader against the error of
consulting Spirits for information or direction about <em>matters of worldly
interest</em>. They will probably get answers, but from mocking and deceptive
Spirits, who step in when the good and true ones decline to intervene.
It is not the mission of good Spirits to mingle in affairs of
mere non-spiritual interest. Beware of what is called &ldquo;business mediumship,&rdquo;
and of directions respecting fortune-making or fortune-telling.
Never forget that there are tricksters and liars out of the flesh
as well as in it; which is little to be wondered at since so many of that
character are daily passing out from the one condition into the other,
when they remain for periods often prolonged, <em>earth-bound</em> by their own
selfish viciousness. We should never do more than ask good Spirits to
guide us by their kindly influences, and then do the best in the situation
that we can according to our best lights of conscience and judgment.
Nor can we ever transfer to Spirit counsellors our own moral
and mental responsibilities.&mdash;A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;U.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ALBANY AND TROY. 1850.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Excursion to Albany&mdash;Delavan House and Van Vechten Hall&mdash;Rev.
Dr. Staats and the Judges&mdash;High Class of Minds
Interested&mdash;President Eliphalet Nott&mdash;Pecuniary Arrangements&mdash;Excursion
to Troy&mdash;Trojan Ladies&mdash;Mob Attempts
on Life of Margaretta.</p>


<h3>EXCURSION TO ALBANY.</h3>

<p>We were directed (by the spirits) to &ldquo;go forth and let
the truth be known.&rdquo; We had already passed through a
terrible experience, and feared to make another such hazardous
attempt; but the fiat had gone forth. We had
debated the question a long time before we could consent
to subject ourselves to another public contest. However,
there was no alternative. We were compelled to
&ldquo;do our duty,&rdquo; regardless of consequences, so far as it was
in our power.</p>

<p>It was the first of April, 1850, when the Rev. R.&nbsp;P.
Ambler and Mr. D.&nbsp;F. Coman, of Springfield, Mass., called
on us for an evening séance. They came with an introduction
from our friend Apollus Munn. Mr. Ambler was
a Universalist minister, had preached in Albany, and was
much respected there. They were greatly astonished by
the evidence they received during the séance; and it
proved to them clearly that their communications were
received from spirits, or from some power entirely beyond
our knowledge. Various circumstances point to the conclusion
that these arrangements had been planned and
directed for us by our spirit friends and guides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>We had been informed by the spirits that we should have
a proper person to lecture for us; and were told that we
should first go to Albany, engage a public hall, and allow
the spirit-rapping to be heard by the audience. We did
not, however, dare to attempt such a venture until we had
made another experiment in our own city (Rochester).
Only five months previously we had left Corinthian Hall,
triumphantly indeed, but amid a howling mob. But they
had been kept at bay and overpowered by superior forces,
and we tried by the public, and not found guilty.</p>

<p>Once again we engaged a hall, at our own expense, and
gave notice to the public that Mr. Ambler would deliver a
lecture, and &ldquo;the three sisters would accompany him on
the platform.&rdquo; The hall was crowded. The lecturer was
eloquent and the audience pleased. The rappings were
profuse. Public opinion had changed since the first lectures
on the subject. <em>Friends</em> rushed to the platform to
congratulate us on our triumphant success.</p>

<p>Many good wishes for our happiness and prosperity in
our great enterprise were showered upon us; and we little
dreamed that we had given our last public entertainment
to our true and tried friends in Rochester. We did not
even imagine that we were then leaving our dear old home
for a new one in a new city, when the proper time should
arrive. There was much and arduous consultation respecting
the mode in which we should go forth into the
world on the travels and toils that lay before us.</p>

<p>Our father had been interrupted in all his business arrangements,
and could not possibly leave home, and Calvin,
who had grown up in our family (a son and brother
by adoption), was the best personal protector we could
have. We left with our father&rsquo;s sympathy and blessing.</p>

<p>We reached Albany the last of April, 1850. We engaged
a suite of rooms in the Delavan House. Mr. Ambler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was our lecturer, and Mr. Coman our business man&mdash;mother,
Maggie, Katie, and myself, with Calvin as our
escort. We engaged Van Vechten Hall. It had been
previously announced through the papers that &ldquo;the Fox
Family&rdquo; would appear at the hall, with Mr. Ambler, who
would deliver a course of lectures, preparatory to our giving
séances at the Delavan House.</p>

<p>Our career was now commenced. After all our resolving
not to go any more before the public, we had been
forced to let the world know what was revealed to us, and
what was meant not for us alone.</p>

<p>Our rooms were thronged by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of Albany and of
many other places adjacent. Our success was great, as the
spirits had promised. We received both public and private
parties from all parts of the country.</p>

<p>The spirits had performed their parts admirably for
nearly two weeks, when I received a note from the editor
of the <cite>Albany Morning Express</cite>.</p>

<p>(It will be remembered that at one of the Rochester investigations,
a Second Advent minister had deemed it his
duty to rise in public and express his idea that all this
was of diabolic origin, and that <em>we</em>, the mediums, ought to
be sent to prison. But the good old days of Cotton
Mather and of the hangings at Salem were past, and after
the conscientious but narrow bigot resumed his seat, no
further notice was taken of the good man or of his suggestion.
I may remark in passing, that the spirits who
extorted from Mr. MacNaughton the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, which
he had been taught in childhood to repeat at the knees of
his &ldquo;puir auld mither,&rdquo; and had converted him to Spiritualism
and a belief in the immortality of the soul, would
seem to have been strange emissaries of Satan.)</p>

<p>At Albany we met a somewhat similar experience, both
in the attempt made against us and in its results. A certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
respectable minister, I do not know of what denomination,
named Dr. Staats, was so far exercised in his mind
by the reports of our meetings at the Delavan House, that
he applied to the courts for a warrant for our arrest. I
had the surprise of receiving the following note from the
highly respected editor of the <cite>Morning Express</cite>:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Albany Morning Express</span>,<br />
<span class="dt">&ldquo;May 13, 1850.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish:</span> I have just this moment been called upon
by the judges of the court before whom Rev. Dr. Staats
would have brought you, had he been able so to do, who
say they would be pleased to call on you this afternoon, at
four o&rsquo;clock, as they will then be at leisure. Can you accommodate
them? I think it will be a grand move to
have them witness the demonstrations. I would call, but
am so busy this morning that even&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;is out of my
mind.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2d">&ldquo;In great haste,</span><br />
<span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Yours respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Jacob C. Cuyler.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>At precisely the appointed time the expected party of
judges and lawyers arrived, numbering seventeen, all
men of distinction. They were just and honest men, with
open, judicial minds, seeking only the truth, and not the
gratification of hostile prejudices. The proprietor of the
house, Mr. Rozelle, was ill in bed; but he rose, dressed
himself, and went down to meet the judicial party before
they left his house. They said to him, when they left,
&ldquo;It will take wiser judges than we are to pronounce
against them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judges came frequently to see us afterward; and
thus, through the Rev. Dr. Staats&rsquo;s efforts to injure us, and
have us arrested for &ldquo;blasphemy against the holy scriptures,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a strong army was raised up for our protection.
And this result we found was invariably the case through
all our subsequent public career.</p>

<p>Wherever and whenever an attempt was made to show
to the world that it was not true, however hostile and
powerful the men engaged against us, we always&mdash;without
a single exception&mdash;were brought through our difficulties
in triumph, although, at times, we could not see how we
were to escape the entanglements often thrown around us.
We placed ourselves wholly under the directions of our
spirit friends, and invariably came out with safety and
honor, as they told us we should, if we but acted our parts
faithfully.</p>

<p>Before the time arrived for us to leave Albany, we had
been deluged with letters, by reputable parties, from all
parts of the country, urging us to come and afford them
an opportunity for themselves to investigate. Of course
we could not comply with all these requests, as we could
at the time only give attention to the principal cities.</p>

<p>During our stay in Albany our rooms were thronged
with anxious investigators from all the neighboring towns
and cities. We usually met the higher order of intelligences;
as the conceited nabob and the equally conceited
representative of the (morally) lower classes, were seldom
attracted to subjects beyond their comprehension and
above their sympathies.</p>

<p>My books of registration plainly show the class of minds
which became interested in Spiritualism at that early day.
I shall preserve them. They should be placed in some
historical library, so that generations yet to come may
realize the fact that Spiritualism was first sought after by
the most enlightened and progressive minds of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>I will not here record the names of my attached friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and constant visitors (with but two exceptions) of that
most interesting period&mdash;two remarkable for their advanced
years as well as for their high personal distinction,
the Rev. Dr. Eliphalet Nott, President of Union College,
Schenectady, and Mr. Edward C. Delavan, the owner
(though not the proprietor) of the house at which we resided.
The latter was nearly, if not quite, an octogenarian,
and certainly cut a somewhat remarkable figure by
the side of his young wife and their baby of ten months.
On one occasion he was so delighted with some communication,
addressed to him by his pet name of childhood,
from his long-departed mother, that he was overflowing
in his expressions of gratitude, and he forced into my
hand a twenty-dollar gold piece. The not less venerable
Dr. Nott once laid his hand on my head and said, &ldquo;My
child, I am not far from the time when I shall go to the
world of spirits, of which you reveal and prove so much;
and you must, naturally, long survive me in the present
life; but if it shall be in my power I will strive to be one
of your guardian spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the proper place to state the pecuniary arrangement
dictated to us by our spirit friends for the support
and prosecution of this mission to the world, which they
had imposed upon us. Our public meetings were held
in Van Vechten Hall, then the principal one in Albany.
Our suite of rooms in the Delavan was the best in the
house. Of course our expenses were very heavy; often
amounting to $150 a week. Our regular charge was $1
each person, and, for a private séance of an hour, $5
for two or more persons. These figures had been prescribed
to us. We never heard of any complaints of
dissatisfaction, on the part of our visitors, with the evidences
which they used to receive; and no language would
suffice to tell of the hundreds of assurances of delight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
gratitude, which were the better part of our compensation
for the time thus absorbed, and for the fatigue and exhaustion
of these labors under the direction of our friends in
the spirit life.</p>


<h3>EXCURSION TO TROY.</h3>

<p>It is with regret that I dismiss so briefly, as has been
done above, our experiences in Albany, where we began
in May, 1850, what may be called the first stage of the
fulfilment of our mission. I might fill this volume with
my reminiscences and notes of them.</p>

<p>It was on May 24, 1850, that we left Albany and went
to Troy. Many Trojans had visited our rooms in Albany,
and urged us to spend a few days in Troy before going
to New York. We consented to do so, much against
our own wishes, as we had made our arrangements to go
from Albany direct to New York. We were kindly received
at the Troy House, and our rooms were thronged
as elsewhere. Our success was gratifying to us all. But
we were not long permitted to enjoy such peace and prosperity.
A murmur arose among the &ldquo;women,&rdquo; whose
conduct toward us in Troy was cruel and unchristianlike.
They insinuated that if the mediums were men their
husbands would not become so deeply enlisted in this unpopular,
and, seemingly, weird subject. They adopted the
absurd theory of toe and knee rapping. One lady especially
distinguished herself by her intellectual antics in this
her line of procedure. (Her husband was much younger
than herself, handsome and prosperous.) She became violent
in her denunciations. I well knew that, with the aid
of Heaven, we could easily prove such accusations false.
We met our combatants on their own premises. A committee
of &ldquo;investigators&rdquo; was gotten up, composed of three
ladies and two ministers. We submitted to all of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
suggestive whims, and came off, as usual, triumphant.
The course and result of this committee of investigation
induced many persons to visit our rooms who had never
before been interested in the subject. We made many
life friends in Troy, and left promising to visit them soon
again (which we did a few months later).</p>

<p>The evening before we left we were honored by a band
of music in front of the Troy House. The proprietor,
Mr. Coleman, and General Viele came to our rooms and
announced the fact, saying, &ldquo;Ladies, this is expressly for
you.&rdquo; He accompanied us to the balcony, where, with uncovered
heads, the crowd saluted us with their hearty applause
of approbation. The following evening we took the
night boat from Albany, and were soon on the beautiful
Hudson wending our way to the city of New York.</p>

<p>But as this chapter is so short, I may as well, at the expense
of chronology in my narrative, anticipate a few
months, to introduce here a serious adventure which befell
my young child-sister Margaretta, or Maggie, at this same
city of Troy, or rather West Troy, in the following month
of November, 1850. It is a curious illustration of the
desperate bitterness of feeling which arose in some portions
of the more ignorant classes in some of our American
communities.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Margaretta_Fox_Kane."></a>
<img src="images/illus05.jpg" width="348" height="476" alt="Margaretta Fox Kane." title="Margaretta Fox Kane." />
</div>

<p>In it we see a striking revival of the old Salem (and
mediæval) spirit of animosity against the so-called &ldquo;witchcraft;&rdquo;
a spirit which was perhaps stimulated by the same
mistaken and misguided religious zeal which some couple
of centuries before had hurried to the stake, the scaffold,
or the nearest pond or river, many a poor victim to the unhappy
and misunderstood gift of what we now know as
mediumship. In the month of November, 1850, a mob
attempt was made to destroy the life of Margaretta while
visiting at the house of Mr. R.&nbsp;M. Bouton. The mob was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
composed of a very low order of society, and were urged
to do the work by prompters, who kept themselves in the
background. Though not on the same scale of dimensions
in numbers, mother and I at a later day concurred in
recognizing in the riotous mob in New York, in July, 1863,
features in the conduct of the men and women (the latter
seemed not less savage than the former) that curiously reminded
us of the terrible scenes of West Troy. They
had evidently been put up to regard this communication
with spirits as deviltry which it was right and proper to
crush out even by taking our lives. They doubtless supposed,
that by destroying our lives the whole matter would
be put to rest. Accordingly her (Margaretta)&rsquo;s every
movement was watched, so that it was not safe for her to
leave the house unattended. Finally the house was forcibly
attacked; but being well barricaded and garrisoned
the &lsquo;fort was held&rsquo; and the assassins were not successful.
The following letter from Mr. Bouton will explain the
facts:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">West Troy</span>, November 13, 1850.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Fish:</span> We are endeavoring to make
arrangements for Maggie to go to another place. If she
has mentioned the name of the place to you, keep it a
secret as you value her life. A deep plot is laid to destroy
her. My house is beset every night by a most determined
murderous mob; and we guard her every moment.
We think if we can place her where we wish to, she
will be safe. I shall defend her and her reputation at the
risk of my fortune and my life. I will advise you of our
progress; suppress the name of the place, if you can. I
write with difficulty, not having rested for several nights.
Five villanous-looking fellows are watching the house
night and day. She has never left my house unattended,
which has foiled them thus far. On returning late from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
East Troy, a few nights past, with my wife, her sister,
Maggie, and myself, in our family coach, when we reached
the river we found no boat. The five men above mentioned
were there, and they tried to persuade my driver to
go by the way of the long Troy bridge (a <em>glorious</em> place
for murder). We did not go, but they followed us home,
and after we had retired attempted to break into the room
occupied by Margaretta and my sister-in-law. They were
furious on being defeated, and threw stones against the
house and fired through the windows. I have procured
means of defence, but we cannot sleep nights, and get
very little rest during the days. They will, no doubt, return
again to-night, but they will meet a warm reception,
as many of our friends from East Troy will be with us.
Last night Mrs. B. and Maggie went to the door of a shed
in the rear together; but the fiends were on the watch
and fired at them, with angry exclamations at there being
some one with her. They were all large, strong men.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="r2">A postscript to this letter, dated the next day, says:</p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;As I feared, the men did return last night, and broke
into the house; but we were prepared for them, and they
did not effect any thing. Come immediately, if you can.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="r2">The mob increased on the following night (Saturday),
and on Sunday I received five telegraphic despatches to
come to Troy, as follows:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, November 16, 1850.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;This despatch has been received from West Troy for
<span class="smcap">Mrs. A. Leah Fish</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send your mother here, or come yourself, by Monday
night. It is of vital importance. Answer by telegraph
at once.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;R.&nbsp;M. Bouton.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>On receipt of this telegram I immediately telegraphed
to know its meaning, and received the following in reply:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, November 16, 1850.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;This despatch has just been received from West Troy
for <span class="smcap">Mrs. A. Leah Fish</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be here by Monday night, 18th inst. It is
of <em>vital</em> importance.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;R.&nbsp;M. Bouton.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>I then telegraphed back to Mr. B. begging him to explain
the situation of my sister, when immediately I received
the following:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, November 17, 1850.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;This despatch has just been received from West Troy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. A. Leah Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister is alive and well, but in great danger.
Safe at present.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;R.&nbsp;M. Bouton.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>I started for Troy on the first train East the next morning.
When I reached Schenectady I had to change cars
for Troy.</p>

<p>I had just taken a seat, at about the middle of the car,
when a rough-looking man sat down beside me, and commenced
interrogating me as to where I was going, etc. I
endeavored to be civil, but I suspected him of having something
to do with the mob. After a while he left and held
a long conversation with two men, near the front of the
car, very like himself in appearance, and soon returned,
taking his seat beside me again. I had moved to the
other end of the seat, and maintained my position, thereby
compelling him to press through in front of me with some
difficulty. When again he attempted to speak to me I
took up my satchel and left the seat entirely to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
He <em>again</em> followed me, but this time I braced myself up
and called the conductor (who had been watching his behavior
all the way), and requested him to &ldquo;compel this man
to leave,&rdquo; which he did immediately.</p>

<p>There were very few persons in the car; I think not
more than seven in all. It was evident that he had a design
against me; but he expected to meet an older person,
and was thrown off his course by my youthful appearance.
He had doubtless expected to meet mother. They had
made inquiries of a passenger who had taken the car from
Schenectady, and who afterward told Mr. B. that those
men said they were expecting to meet a lady from Rochester;
but that she was older than the lady on the car, etc.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that I should stop at the Troy
House on my arrival at East Troy. It was eight o&rsquo;clock
<span class="lower">P.M.</span>, and very dark. As I stepped out of the car on to
the platform, I saw a carriage standing in front of the
hotel, and supposed it was for me, as had been previously
arranged. At this moment a gentleman stepped up, and
after a close scrutiny said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am right, it is Leah; I know you by your resemblance
to Maggie,&rdquo; and motioning me to silence.</p>

<p>Another gentleman stepped on my other side, and they
guarded me to the carriage each with a drawn revolver.
On entering the carriage I saw three loaded pistols lying
on the seat in front of me. It is difficult to say which I
most feared, the mob or the pistols. The religious telegraphic
operator had evidently revealed the correspondence
between Mr. Bouton and myself, as there was no
other source through which it could have been made
known that I was expected.</p>

<p>A number of disorderly persons followed the carriage
and crossed the ferry with us. No attempt was made to
disturb us; but on reaching Mr. B.&rsquo;s house we found it surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
by a reinforced mob. I had been instructed how
to conduct myself on our arrival. I was told that two or
three gentlemen would rush from the door and suddenly
carry me in. Accordingly, when the carriage stopped close
to the door steps I found myself in the arms of three strong
men, who landed me safely. I found Maggie sick and
nearly paralyzed with fright. There were strong-armed
forces for protection on our side. We had not been in the
house ten minutes when several shots were fired and stones
thrown, breaking everything in their way. We crouched
beneath the furniture, and lay on the floor to escape the
bullets, expecting at every moment some stray shot or
stone would strike us. (Our hiding-room was in the interior
of the house.) The mob threatened and did all in
their power to destroy us; but, knowing the gentlemen
inside were so well prepared for them, they retired for the
night. They, however, continued their watchfulness until
we left the place. Mr. Bouton&rsquo;s house stood in the outskirts
of West Troy, near a lumber yard, a capital hiding-place
for a mob, and I am not sure there were any policemen
there at that time. Poor Maggie&rsquo;s nerves were
terribly unstrung. She would start in her sleep and cry
out fearfully, believing she was still besieged by the mob.
She was too ill to be taken home, and I managed (with
the aid of friends) to get her to Albany, where we remained
several weeks at the Delavan House. During our
stay in Albany, the identical men who met me and followed
me from Schenectady to West Troy were prowling
about my home in Rochester. All the circumstances connected
with the affair show conclusively that there was a
deep-laid scheme to destroy us, and that these men had
been appointed to accomplish that object; but, like every
other attempt at violence against us, they met with nothing
but discomfiture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">NEW YORK. 1850.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">&ldquo;The Rochester Knockings at Barnum&rsquo;s Hotel&rdquo;&mdash;Hard Work&mdash;Our
Visitors&mdash;A Poisoned Bouquet&mdash;Hair of the Emperor
Napoleon&nbsp;I.&mdash;Hair of John C. Calhoun&mdash;Investigation at
Residence of Rev. Rufus W. Griswold, by the Leading
Literary Celebrities of New York.</p>


<h3>FIRST VISIT TO NEW YORK.</h3>

<p>We arrived in New York City on June 4, 1850, and
had engaged rooms at Barnum&rsquo;s Hotel, corner of Broadway
and Maiden Lane. (This proprietor must not be confounded
with the great showman of that name.)</p>

<p>Horace Greeley was our first caller. He advised us to
charge five dollars admission fee. I told him that would
be altogether too much; but he feared greatly for our
safety, and thought this exorbitant sum would keep the
rabble away. I told him I thought it decidedly better to
follow the directions of the Spirits, and trust in Providence
for protection and success. He announced our arrival in
the <cite>Tribune</cite>, and published our rules of order. The editors
of the <cite>Tribune</cite> and many other papers were in our
rooms daily. Mr. Ripley used to say to us: &ldquo;Ladies, you
are the lions of New York.&rdquo; Mary Taylor, in a Broadway
theatre, sweetly sang &ldquo;The Rochester Knockings at Barnum&rsquo;s
Hotel,&rdquo; as a popular topic of the day. Many things
in stores, on sidewalks, and newspaper advertisements,
were paraded and labelled with the words &ldquo;Rochester
Knockings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a time, to be sure, we had of it during that first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
visit, of nearly three months, to the great metropolis!
Our party was seven in number. Our parlor was a large
room opposite to the main one of the hotel, from which it
was separated by a wide corridor. A long table with
thirty seats occupied the centre of it, and we gave three
receptions each day, for which our advertised hours were:
10 to 12 <span class="lower">A.M.</span>, 3 to 5 <span class="lower">P.M.</span>, and 8 to 10 <span class="lower">P.M.</span>; but the midday
meeting would often lengthen out till we had barely
time to get ready for dinner, and the evening one to midnight.
The public parlors served as ante-rooms, in which
visitors waited their turns to be admitted by one of our attendant
gentlemen. Private sittings were often extorted
from us by importunity, which would begin at the earliest
hours before breakfast. With what degree of exhaustion
of muscles, nerves, mind and spirit, we would reach our
beds (in our rooms on the floor above), where sleep was
often slow to come to our over-strained systems, may be
imagined by my readers. The mere pressure upon us of
the three successive crowds would, alone, have been a
strain hard to bear; but every individual had his or her
colloquies to be held with their respective Spirit friends.
The burthen of it fell upon us all, but most heavily upon
our dear mother, who took it so deeply to heart when she
knew we were so unjustly suspected and so severely tested.
She was of course always present with us, but only as a
spectator and for protection. Ministers of all denominations,
members of all professions, legal, medical, literary,
and commercial, were among our guests, and many of them
were frequent visitors. The occasions were rare when the
slightest want of courtesy, respect, and kindness occurred
to wound or displease us; and the only thing approaching
an indignity we had to complain of among ourselves, was
the frequency with which committees of ladies would retire
with us to disrobe and reclothe us, the holding of our feet, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the thousands of strangers who streamed
through our rooms, I, of course, could know or remember
the names of but few individuals; and many an one had
his or her designation by which we used to recognize them,
as&mdash;the White Spirit, or the Black, or the Gray, the Count,
the Slick Wig, the Old Oriental, the Hippopotamus, etc.,
etc. By the way, the Count was also an elderly gentleman
with white hair and angelic eyes, a foreigner, who at parting
made me a present of a set of old china of extreme
rarity, for which I have since refused a dealer&rsquo;s offer of
a thousand dollars, and which I still employ at parties
and fêtes, and particular occasions, and always with a kind
thought of the dear old donor. The summer season of
travel, of course, brought many Southerners to our rooms,
as well as visitors from other cities of the Union.</p>

<p>We again passed through an ordeal of special investigation
by a large committee of the first men of New York,
in scientific and literary, as well as social distinction, which
took place at the residence of the Rev. Rufus W. Griswold,
for some account of which, and the signal triumph
in which it resulted, I refer to a letter which will be found
<a href="#Page_154">further on</a>, and which was extensively republished.</p>

<p>Only one very painful thing occurred: an anonymous
present made to me of a large, superb bouquet of flowers,
the smelling of which nearly cost me my life. I was
thought to be at death&rsquo;s door; and a week had passed before
I fully recovered from the effect. Spirits told us that
it had proceeded from the malignity of a hostile quarter,
and that the bouquet was poisoned.</p>

<p>I have always had a peculiar sensitiveness to poison; and
could not even now, in the open air, pass near to certain
growing plants, such as poison ivy, without suffering sensibly
from their vicinity.</p>

<p>There was another occasion on which evil was not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
intended, but attempted, by some who falsely believed they
were doing God service by breaking up the &ldquo;pestilent
Rochester knockings.&rdquo; We, too, had our case of a
&ldquo;prophet&rdquo; (Isaiah) sent to curse, but who remained to
bless. Our &ldquo;prophet,&rdquo; of whom this was true, was none
other than the famous Captain I. Rynders, well known as
the Captain of the Empire Club&mdash;a Democratic party organization
of &ldquo;fighting men,&rdquo; the counterpoise to a corresponding
body on the other side of politics. These rival
corps had, originally, for their business the breaking up of
the meetings of the adverse party, or to defend those of
their own party against similar attacks from the opposite
fighting corps. Captain Rynders, though a rather slender
man, was one of such pluck, energy, and resolution, that
his very name came to represent a real power in New
York. His politics, in which he was very zealous, made
him (as most men of that day were, on both sides) very
hostile to &ldquo;the Abolitionists,&rdquo; many a meeting of whom
the Empire Club had broken up after the most summary
of fashions, namely, through windows as well as doors.
One day three men, one of them of Herculean proportions,
with his shirt-collar wide open, sailor fashion, on a brown
sunburnt neck, entered our parlor, after payment of their
regular fee outside, and took their seats together; the
Hercules next to me. His appearance was every way formidable.
A certain slight commotion was manifest in the
company on their entrance. I soon received from three different
friends in the room (Mr. Greeley, George Ripley,
and another) little billets warning me against &ldquo;the most
dangerous man in New York&rdquo;&mdash;whose appearance &ldquo;portended
evil,&rdquo; and telling me to be &ldquo;extremely careful&rdquo; of
all I should say and do, etc. One lady bent over me from
behind, handed me a bit of paper which spoke of &ldquo;black
danger clouds,&rdquo; and a row as being imminent from &ldquo;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
men,&rdquo; and then made her escape into one of the more remote
parlors of the hotel. But they sat quietly as observers.
There were several clergymen in the company, one of
them being the celebrated Dr. Phelps, of Stratford, Conn.
There were at the table also two elderly, tall, thin, and pale
Quaker maiden ladies, a little ghostly perhaps in appearance,
one of whom presently addressed to the Spirits the
question, &ldquo;Which is the more correct, the Bible or Andrew
Jackson Davis&rsquo;s Revelations?&rdquo; To this came many raps,
which were differently understood around the table, according
to the various opinions. It made quite a sensation.
I rose and said that those raps were not an answer to the
question, but a call for the alphabet, which I proceeded to
repeat aloud as usual. The answer returned was: &ldquo;The
Bible contains many true and beautiful things, and so also
does Davis&rsquo;s Revelations,&rdquo; a reply which Dr. Phelps considered
a good and wise one. I presently invited one of
my three neighbors (not the Herculean one) to the door,
which I opened, and he was made to hear loud rappings
on the wooden panels, and also on the marble flooring.</p>

<p>My real object was to conciliate him as being one of the
party of &ldquo;danger clouds,&rdquo; though he was not the one who
had been the object of my terror. &ldquo;What is the meaning
of this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have <em>you</em> anything to do with the
Rochester knockings? I thought those two white old
maids were the ones. I was sent here by a religious
society to break it all up, and drive it out of New York,
as I did last week with Fred. Douglass and Julia Griffith,
and their sets of Abolitionists.&rdquo; I told him he had been
very wrong in doing so, and that those ladies were strangers
here, as he and his friends were. &ldquo;What, are <em>you</em>
the Rochester knockers?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, I thought you
were older. Ain&rsquo;t you afraid of me? What, these children!&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I am not a bit afraid of you,&rdquo; I repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
though in my secret heart I was dreadfully afraid of the
other man. &ldquo;Well, I am Captain Rynders&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you
heard of me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I have, but I am not afraid of
you.&rdquo; He took a seat at the table, and I invited him to
ask some questions of some friends of his in the Spirit
world. He asked a brother of his where he had died&mdash;&ldquo;In
California,&rdquo; was the correct reply. &ldquo;Of what disease?&rdquo;
To this also he got a reply, which, with a strong
blow of his fist on the table, he admitted to be correct.</p>

<p>Captain Rynders was now our friend, and a good and
gallant one he proved. He made the <cite>Herald</cite> publish a
long account of it in our favor; the only occasion of its
doing anything of the kind. He said that nobody should
molest us; that he saw no reason why it should be done,
and he emphasized this with a strong blow upon the table.
He was indeed surprised that <em>we</em> were the mediums; he
had supposed them to be the old Quaker women over
there (alas, poor good souls!). My relations soon became
equally comfortable with his big friend also, of
whom I had been so afraid. A letter for me was brought
in and laid on the table between him and me. I noticed
that he seemed to observe the direction on it somewhat
closely. I presently handed the letter over to
mother, saying, &ldquo;Here is a letter from our dear friend
Maria Rogers.&rdquo; Said my big neighbor, &ldquo;Why, where did
you ever know Maria Rogers?&rdquo; &ldquo;In Albany, at the Delavan
House, where her husband had some business position.
She is one of the sweetest women I ever knew, and I love
her dearly. She was also very beautiful.&rdquo; &ldquo;She is all
that you say,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;and she is my own darling
sister.&rdquo; The letter proved to be an invitation to spend
Sunday with her at the Oceanic House. I had no further
fear of her big brother, who, together with Captain Rynders,
would certainly have pitched all the rest of the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
out of the window in our defence, had it been
necessary. Such was the conversion of our &ldquo;prophet,&rdquo;
from the cursing for which he had been commissioned, to
blessings. I have since been assured by those who knew
him, that Captain Rynders was really a good man at
heart, with other manly qualities besides his courage, notwithstanding
his animosity against the Abolitionists of
that period, and others against whom the energies of the
Empire Club had been directed by his party. I have
some reason to believe that he has been a happier man
from that time than before. I was sincerely glad to see
him a few weeks ago, when he called on me, by my request,
to compare notes upon our reminiscences of this adventure,
and I was indeed astonished to hear so young a
looking man avow that he was now eighty years of
age.</p>

<p>At all our séances the general character of the manifestations
was that all present heard the explosive sounds or
&ldquo;knockings,&rdquo; whose significance resided in their correspondence
with the letters of the alphabet; while each in
succession had the opportunity of communicating with his
own friends in the spirit life. Nor do I believe that a
single person passed through the experience of one of
those meetings who was not satisfied, in his own sincere
mind, that we had nothing of physical relation to their
production, and that no conceivable mundane means could
have produced them.</p>

<p>Though in our own domestic experience remarkable
phenomena of the physical order had often been produced
by the Spirits, such, for instance, as the rising of objects
in the air, including our own persons, etc., yet nothing of
this kind occurred at these meetings, beyond the phenomenon
of the sitters being touched, sometimes caressingly,
by invisible hands, or having their garments pulled, or their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
chairs or the table moved&mdash;which were frequent experiences
to our visitors.</p>

<p>I cannot afford the space for numerous individual incidents
of interest which occurred at those meetings, but
will mention one, which is not likely to be forgotten by
some of the witnesses to it, who may perhaps read this
page. A stranger came one day, of evident distinction and
advanced years, French, though speaking English; I have
a vague impression that he was a diplomatist. He had
with him a friend. He produced a folded paper or envelope,
and asked if the Spirits could tell him what it contained.
The answer promptly came, &ldquo;A piece of the hair
of the Emperor Napoleon.&rdquo; This naturally arrested the
eager attention of all the company. I trembled with doubt
and fear of a failure. The old gentleman opened the
paper and held up a small piece of hair, and, with tears in
his eyes and quivering lips, said&mdash;either he had been one
of those who accompanied Napoleon on his voyage to St.
Helena, or that he was a friend of the physician who had
accompanied him. After this lapse of time I am not certain
which, but something was said about the physician.
He told how on an occasion of his hair being cut by the
barber, the fallen pieces had been religiously gathered up,
and this was one of them. Turning to his friend who had
come with him, he said, &ldquo;I did not need this evidence, but
this test is evidently intended for you;&rdquo; and then explained
that in the morning his friend, who was an entire unbeliever,
had said, in reference to their intended visit to us,
that if we were subjected to that test, and if it should be
told what were the contents of the envelope, he would be a
believer too. I remember that Mr. Greeley and Mr. Ripley,
of the <cite>Tribune</cite>, were present. If this should fall under
the eye of any survivors of that scene, I should be pleased
to hear from them. None present can have forgotten it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>There were a number of somewhat similar cases of
treasured locks of hair being thus identified by those who
had worn them in life, but though there are many whose
hair is thus preserved by faithful memories, there has been
but one Napoleon the Great.</p>

<p>However, I will further add that if there was but one
Napoleon&nbsp;I., there was also but one John C. Calhoun. One
day a Southern gentleman was at the table, and, having
heard of the above incident respecting the great Emperor,
produced and laid down his pocket-book, asking to know
one thing it contained. &ldquo;Hair of John C. Calhoun,&rdquo; was
the reply. He acknowledged its truth, and exhibited the
lock.</p>

<p>During this our first visit to New York occurred another
&ldquo;investigation&rdquo; by a number of the most eminent
literary and commercial gentlemen of that city, at the residence
of the Rev. Rufus W. Griswold. It included such
men as J. Fenimore Cooper, George Bancroft, Rev. Dr.
Hawks, Dr. John W. Francis, William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel
P. Willis, Dr. Marcy, and others. It had its origin
with the Dr. C.&nbsp;D. Griswold, M.D. (our friend at Rochester,
mentioned on a former page), who came down to New
York expressly to propose it to us, telling us that the high
position of his brother, Rufus W., would enable him to
unite for that purpose the best elements which the great
metropolis could afford. We were only too glad to comply
with so kind and friendly a suggestion. In the wilderness
of my papers I do not find the full records of that interesting
occasion, of which no full formal report was ever issued;
but I well remember that it was highly satisfactory
to ourselves and our friends. All the testings desired,
such as making us stand on cushions, etc., were exhausted.
I recollect that Fenimore Cooper addressed an immense
number of questions to Spirits (my impression is a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and fifty), and received correct replies. I find among
some newspaper scraps a long editorial in a Sunday paper,
by its junior editor, written in the full vein of hostile persiflage
usual at that time with the press, dependent for existence
on its subscription lists, the following as its conclusion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since writing the above, we have read in the <cite>Tribune</cite>
an account of an interview between the Spirits&rsquo; interpreters
and Mr. J. Fenimore Cooper, Mr. George Bancroft, Rev.
Dr. Hawks, Dr. Francis, Mr. Wm. Cullen Bryant, Mr. N.
P. Willis, Dr. Marcy, and other literary celebrities, at the
rooms of the Rev. Doctor Griswold. The responses given
to several of these gentlemen, as reported in the <cite>Tribune</cite>,
were most extraordinary; and yet&mdash;infidel that we are!&mdash;these
replies have not shaken our obstinate incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our senses are the only witnesses we will consent to
trust in relation to phenomena which, if really supernatural,
would upset, among other things, the Christian
Religion,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the verdict of our senses upon all the performances
which have come under our observation.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Any reader desirous of examining the <cite>Tribune&rsquo;s</cite> report
above alluded to, can easily find it in the files of that paper
for 1850. I content myself, for brevity&rsquo;s sake, with the
following extract from Mr. Capron&rsquo;s volume on &ldquo;Spiritualism:
Its Facts and Fanaticisms,&rdquo; etc. (1855), page 172:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But curiosity had so far obtained the mastery of
bigoted opposition as to lead many of the most eminent
men of the city to give the subject a fair investigation.
The result was, as elsewhere, the making of many converts;
and these were not from among men of inferior
intellects or of unbalanced minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long after the arrival of the mediums, a number
of literary gentlemen assembled at the house of Rev.
Dr. Griswold, an Episcopalian clergyman, in Broadway.
Neither of the sisters Fox had ever been at the house before,
and the meeting was called for the purpose of testing,
as far as they were able, the validity of these alleged manifestations.
Among the company were J. Fenimore Cooper,
the novelist, Mr. George Bancroft, the historian, Rev. Dr.
Hawks, Dr. J.&nbsp;W. Francis, Dr. Marcy, Mr. N.&nbsp;P. Willis,
Mr. Wm. Cullen Bryant, the poet, and Mr. Bigelow, of
the <cite>Evening Post</cite>, Mr. Richard B. Kimball, Mr. H. Tuckerman,
and Gen. Lyman. These gentlemen were well
known throughout the country, and the report was well
calculated to carry much weight with it, let it be on which
side it would. The result was highly satisfactory to the
mediums and their friends. On this occasion Mrs. Fox
and her three daughters were present. Mr. Tuckerman
was among the first to interrogate the Spirits. Among his
questions were the following in regard to an individual
whose name he had not spoken, but had simply in his
mind:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did he live in New York?&rsquo; No answer. &lsquo;In Baltimore?&rsquo;
&lsquo;In Cambridge?&rsquo; &lsquo;In Boston?&rsquo;&mdash;Three distinct
raps, which is the sign of an affirmative answer. A negative
reply is indicated by silence. Mr. T. continued, &lsquo;Was
he a lawyer?&rsquo; &lsquo;A merchant?&rsquo; &lsquo;A physician?&rsquo; &lsquo;A clergyman?&rsquo;
Knocks. &lsquo;Was he an Episcopalian?&rsquo; &lsquo;A Presbyterian?&rsquo;
&lsquo;A Unitarian?&rsquo;&mdash;going over the names of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
principal sects. No answer. At the suggestion of a gentleman,
Mr. T. asked &lsquo;Was he a Christian?&rsquo; Knocks.
Mr. T. then asked the age of the person in a series of tens.
&lsquo;Was he twenty years old at the time of his death?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Was he thirty?&rsquo; &lsquo;Forty?&rsquo; &lsquo;Fifty?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sixty?&rsquo; Knocks.
&lsquo;Has he left a family?&rsquo; Knocks. &lsquo;Children?&rsquo; Knocks.
&lsquo;Five?&rsquo; &lsquo;Three?&rsquo; &lsquo;Two?&rsquo; Knocks. &lsquo;Did he die in Boston?&rsquo;
&lsquo;In Philadelphia?&rsquo; &lsquo;In Albany?&rsquo; &lsquo;In Northampton?&rsquo;
&lsquo;In Bennington?&rsquo; Knocks. &lsquo;Did he die of consumption?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Of fever?&rsquo; &lsquo;Of cholera?&rsquo; &lsquo;Of old age?&rsquo; Knocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person in Mr. Tuckerman&rsquo;s mind was the late Dr.
William Ellery Channing, the eminent and liberal Unitarian
divine. He lived in Boston, and died in Bennington,
Vt., while on a journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Francis having fixed in his mind the name of an
individual, the &lsquo;rapping&rsquo; spelled out B-u-r&mdash;when several
of the company exclaimed, spontaneously, &lsquo;Robert Burns.&rsquo;
This was the true answer; and after an interesting interview
with the bard of Scotia, the doctor declined asking
any more questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. James Fenimore Cooper then asked, &lsquo;Is the person
I inquire about a relative?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was at once indicated
by the knocks. &lsquo;A near relative?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;A man?&rsquo;
No answer. &lsquo;A woman?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;A daughter?&rsquo; &lsquo;A
mother?&rsquo; &lsquo;A wife?&rsquo; No answer. &lsquo;A sister?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
Mr. C. then asked the number of years since her death.
Fifty knocks were given, and the number unanimously so
announced by the company. Mr. C. now asked, &lsquo;Did she
die of consumption?&rsquo; and naming several diseases to
which no answer was given. &lsquo;Did she die by accident?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Was she killed by lightning?&rsquo; &lsquo;Was she shot?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Was she lost at sea?&rsquo; &lsquo;Did she fall from a carriage?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Was she thrown from a horse?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cooper here discontinued his investigations, and informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the company that just fifty years ago that present
month he had a sister thrown from a horse and killed,
and that all the answers had been strictly correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ripley, one of the editors of the <cite>Tribune</cite>, a man
of candor and great intelligence, drew up the report of the
whole proceedings, of which the above is but a short extract,
and in conclusion he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evening was now far advanced, and it was not
thought desirable to continue our colloquies any further.
At the suggestion of several gentlemen, the ladies removed
from the sofa, where they had sat during the evening,
and remained standing in another part of the room. The
knockings were now heard on the doors, at both ends of
the room, producing a vibration on the panels which was
felt by every one who touched them. Different gentlemen
stood on the outside and inside of the door at the
same time, when loud knockings were heard on the side
opposite to where they stood. The ladies were at such a
distance from the door, in both cases, as to render no countenance
to the idea that the sounds were produced by any
direct communication with them. They now went into a
parlor under the room in which the party was held, accompanied
by several gentlemen, and the sounds were then
produced with great distinctness, causing sensible vibrations
in the sofa, and apparently coming from a thick
hearth-rug before the fire-place, as well as from other
quarters of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such are the most important facts which we can recall
of the manifestations of the evening. We believe we
have stated them without any coloring whatever, as they
appeared to every one present; but, with regard to their
origin or their nature, we are as much in the dark as any
of our readers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will add to the above but a few lines. After Fenimore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Cooper, and his responsive friends in the Spirit life,
had occupied the floor, so to speak, for a long time, calls
upon him began to arise as to whether any of his answers
were correct. Of course he alone could know, since they
were in the form of raps. Old Dr. Francis, who had sat
with his chin resting on his big cane, and his eyes intently
fixed on Mr. Cooper, as had been the eyes of all the company,
began knocking impatiently on the floor, which example
was followed by others, as in the case of an impatient
audience at a theatre. At last Mr. Cooper gave satisfaction
to their curiosity, now wound up to a high pitch, by saying:
&ldquo;Gentlemen, every single answer has been correct.&rdquo;
This was of course no small relief and satisfaction
to us.</p>

<p>And it was a still greater satisfaction when, after his
death in September of the following year, I received a
visit from Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s nephew, with a note from the
great novelist, one of the last things written by his prolific
pen, and a message from him on his death-bed, substantially
as follows: &ldquo;Tell the Fox family I bless them.
I have been made happy through them. They have prepared
me for this hour.&rdquo;</p>

of the eternal hell-fire, of total depravity, of vicarious atonement, of anything
but One Supreme Spirit or God, and of the literal plenary inspiration
of the Bible; but a vast body of the most enlightened Spiritualists (I believe
the bulk of them) devoutly cherish <em>the Christianity taught, lived,
and died for by Christ himself</em>; and a pamphlet by a well-known and popular
Spiritualist is rightly entitled &ldquo;Christ the Corner-Stone of Spiritualism.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">RETURN TO ROCHESTER.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Letters and Newspaper Articles Respecting our New York
Campaign&mdash;Letter from Amy Post&mdash;Letters from John
E. Robinson&mdash;Article from a Sunday Newspaper&mdash;From
the New York Day-Book&mdash;Letter from Dr. C.&nbsp;D. Griswold&mdash;Letter
from Jacob C. Cuyler&mdash;Article by Horace Greeley&mdash;Poem
from the Sunday Dispatch.</p>


<p>Such was our first campaign in New York, through all
the hot months of that summer of 1850. Toward the
close of September our friends, as well as ourselves, recognized
the necessity for us of some rest and recuperation,
and we decided to return to Rochester. But before being
allowed to do so, our kind and devoted friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Greeley, insisted on our spending a fortnight with
them at their home in Nineteenth Street. We also spent
a week with other friends at Greenpoint. But this did
not afford much relief to our overwrought brains and
bodies, because Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s hospitable house was a centre
of visiting to the literary circles of New York, and Spiritualism
and its manifestations, for the satisfaction of their
visitors, were almost as much the order of our days as
had been the case at Barnum&rsquo;s Hotel, among countless
more. Bayard Taylor was at that period very earnest in
his investigations, and was a daily frequenter of the house.
At last we were suffered to tear ourselves away from New
York; and ah, what sighs of relief we breathed when we
got back to our dearly beloved Rochester, where we resumed
our former happy domestic life, in which we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
divided our days, going at pleasure to and fro, between
my house on Troup Street and the farm, the homestead
and father&rsquo;s house, now a sort of adjunct to the latter;
every one of which dwellings was always an open house to
any one of the family.</p>

<p>This affords a convenient point at which to introduce a
few out of the many letters from valued friends referring
to our time and experiences in New York. I give the first
place to one from that best, sweetest, and noblest of women,
Amy, wife of Isaac Post, friends in the double sense of
intimacy, and the denominational one, for both she and
her husband, who were all but second parents to me,
were, as they still are, perfect specimens of the ideal
Quakerism.</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y.</span>, May 30, 1850.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Leah</span>: I have very often thought of you since you
left our goodly city, and have as often desired to communicate
with you, but I hardly know where to direct a letter
to find you; though I might have known that your movements
would be slow, for strange, indeed, it would be if
you did not find people enough, in every place you visited,
interested in the remarkable phenomena that attend you,
to keep you a long time. It is almost useless to say that
we always rejoice whenever we hear of your prosperity,
either temporally or spiritually; and while we do exceedingly
miss you and feel your loss, we are thankful that
you are affording <em>others</em> the privilege of witnessing what
we have so often enjoyed. When will you find a stopping
place? Sometimes I think <em>not this side of Europe</em>, but
perhaps my ideas are too boundless. You, and the good
angels that are with you, can better tell; but wherever
you may go, my heart and good wishes go with you.
John E. Robinson kindly read to me some parts of thy
letter. I was very grateful for thy kind remembrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
us, and much pleased to hear, from thy own pen, of your
comfortable situation, company, etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please present my love to thy mother, Calvin, and both
the dear girls. Willet says, &lsquo;I want to see Leah and
Margaretta.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2a">&ldquo;Thy affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Amy Post.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<hr class="l3" />

<p>The following two are from a true and lifelong friend
(also in the twofold sense), John E. Robinson, of whom I
could not, with either justice or truth, speak in terms any
less strong than those above applied to my beloved Amy
and Isaac Post.</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, Friday, June 21, 1850.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah:</span> Your anxiously looked for letter
came to me Thursday morning last, and gave me a great
deal of pleasure in the reading. It was worth more than
all the newspapers I have seen in a twelvemonth, because
it gave me an interior view of your temporary home, and
a sketch of several things which I wanted to know something
of. It was all of interest to me, from the top of the
first page to the last line of the tenth; and I promise not
to scold you any more, for I observe much of it was written
during late hours of the night, when you could not
help but be worn with fatigue. The only wonder is that
at such time you could find room in your memory for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Leah, what think you Mr. Jones told me?
a bit of gossip about you and a millionaire, somewhere
about Troy, or Albany. He told it as a special secret, and
left me to make the most of it. It is capital. When do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
you <em>go off</em>? I shall be expecting a delicate note on satin
paper, addressed to me, tied with a love-knot of matrimonial
ribbon, stating when you will be &lsquo;at home.&rsquo; Very
well, do as you think best. It&rsquo;s no use for me to cross
your path when you get fairly &lsquo;on a train,&rsquo; and, so far
as my advice is concerned, I think you are smart enough
in such matters, and can only say to you, as the lawyer
said to the young man who taught him a lesson in roguery,
&lsquo;You need no lesson from me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was pleased with the account of your ramble in Hoboken,
but wish you had taken some other day for the excursion,
as the one in question always brings there such a
crowd of the &lsquo;lower ten.&rsquo; I hate crowds! though even
in them there is a difference. Commend me to a mass of
Sunday-clad peasantry rather than a crowd of the lower
strata of New York&mdash;or the equally unpleasant sham aristocracy
of Rochester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember those shaded walks of Hoboken. They
are among the beautiful things and pleasant places, the
memory of which is stored away in my attic story. I
suppose you will see all the points of attraction before you
turn your steps homeward. You will not go further eastward,
I suppose. If you should go to Boston, go by way
of Newport, and visit its beach. That famous beach, at
the hour of early morning or just at evening twilight, is
one of the grandest sights I ever looked upon. I won&rsquo;t
attempt to describe it to you; but, if you <em>can</em> see it, the
memory thereof will not die out from your mind. The
eye and the ear have kindred offices. They are, both of
them, organs through which the soul within us takes cognizance
of beauty. The magnificent stave of music which
has once trembled on the tympanum, is forever prisoned
in the spirit&mdash;&lsquo;a thing of beauty;&rsquo; and so each glorious
form of nature on which the eye has rested, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
spirit drank in its inspiration, remains &lsquo;a joy forever.&rsquo;
And <em>this</em> we call Memory. Why do we call it so? Because
it is one of those mysterious powers of the human
soul for which we have no other name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am forgetting what to say to you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your particular mention of a number of your visitors
is very agreeable to me. What a pity I cannot accept
your invitation, and spend a week with you. You must
remember everything you see and hear, and tell me all
when you come home. I am very glad you like Mr.
Hopper. He is a queer fellow&mdash;when he has a mind to
be. He can veil the greatest amount of fun under the
most serious face, of any one I know. He carries a &lsquo;band
of music&rsquo; under that Quaker physiognomy of his. I have
often been talking to him seriously, and stopped short to
tell him I could not read him. I did not know whether
his thoughts were mine or exactly the opposite. His remarkable
father, Isaac T. Hopper, is one of the noblest-hearted
beings in this wide world. His whole life has
been marked by acts of most perfect benevolence and devotion
to the cause of Truth and Humanity. I was
pleased with N.&nbsp;P. Willis&rsquo;s article in <cite>The Home Journal</cite>,
though written in his peculiar vein, and regret to learn
that he has been subjected to such an outrage at the
hands of the actor Edwin Forrest. I know nothing of
Willis&rsquo;s morals, but should suppose him above anything
mean, or what would render him justly amenable to the
censure of those who have long admired him as a leading
journalist and charming writer. It is a sad, sad day for a
man or woman who have made for themselves a home in
thousands of hearts, and ministered to us in our holiday
hours, when he or she stoops from that admired eminence,
and becomes a thing for scorn to point its finger at. I
will not believe <em>this</em> of Nathaniel Parker Willis&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
author of a thousand gems of thought which he has scattered
up and down in my memory like spring flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our daily press is just what it was. You cannot expect
anything else from papers with little talent, and no courage,
at the editorial helm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come across such a man as Horace Greeley will
recommend as one of his own stamp, tell him Western
New York wants a journalist who is up and dressed and
afraid of nobody; and if he will come out here, and pitch
into &rsquo;em, he will make his fortune and serve the country.
I&rsquo;ve a thought in my mind, and will give it to you for
what it is worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after the meeting at Doctor Griswold&rsquo;s, I saw in
the N.&nbsp;Y. <cite>Evening Post</cite> (what was very proper&mdash;so far as
it went, because it did not charge <em>you</em> with originating
these phenomena, but only disclaimed belief in their
Spiritual nature), a sort of disclaimer evidently by one of
the persons present who took the privilege of speaking for
the others (or most of them). Now the fact is that, if anything
which has engrossed a large share of public attention
is really worthy of serious investigation, the <em>result of
such investigation</em> is equally worthy to be made publicly
known. And as the prominent minds in New York can
most effectually do this, they, or those of them who have
had the opportunity to arrive at fair conclusions, ought to
be willing to state that result in explicit language, over
their proper signatures. It would be but a simple act of
justice to you; a satisfaction to the multitudes who are
prevented, by a thousand considerations, from seeing you;
and no dishonor to them. Before you leave, if it meets
the approbation of your best friends, I would have it done.
It would give you a <em>vantage ground</em>, from whence you
could all look down upon the miserable scribblers who
have been eking out <em>their</em> existence by abusing <em>you</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Write soon, and tell me what has transpired since your
last letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My love to you all.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;J.&nbsp;E. Robinson.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, July 28, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah:</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your welcome letter came to me last Tuesday. I have
been very anxious to hear from you. You write so seldom,
and I am always anticipating your letters long before they
reach me. I am sorry to learn that you have been afflicted,
but frequently wonder you are not all sick from
the effect of continued application to the duties which devolve
on you. I sympathize with you often in your thousand
and one perplexities of mind and body. It gives me
pleasure to know that the friends stand by you through all
trials; and you will, I doubt not, find in your mind that
appreciation of them that will secure a pleasing recollection
when you shall have left them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that &lsquo;you all wish to come home, and will
probably return <em>soon</em>.&rsquo; Now, I wish I could believe that
word has any significance in such connection; but it has
become such a misnomer, in Spiritual things, that it is a
great sinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I shut out the reality of things around me,
and fancy you all here again. For the moment, I am
pleasingly deceived, and again I stand within the charmed
circle of the Rochester Seeresses. I hear your bursts of
laughter, and look deep into your dark eyes to read what
manner of thought is passing behind the Spirit windows.
You are glad to see me. Maggie and Kate also give a like
evidence. But I am only dreaming; you are away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
as far off as you were two months ago. I have little expectation
of seeing you in less than two months; there
are reasons which will keep you away so long, notwithstanding
you speak of coming home. But I don&rsquo;t wish to
hasten you. You know what is best, and will act accordingly.
I should be sorry if you should do anything that
you would afterward regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most familiar Spiritualists&mdash;if that term is proper,
now hold weekly sociables here. We have met but twice
as yet, but design continuing them each Sunday evening.
The last Sunday and this we met at the house of Mr.
Granger, and passed the hours very much to our satisfaction.
There were present Mr. and Mrs. Granger, Mr. and
Mrs. Post, Mr. Hammond, Mr. W.&nbsp;A. Langworthy, Mr.
Jarvis, Mr. Edward Jones, George Willets, Mr. Rich, and
the writer of this. The design is to have these meetings
tend to the mutual improvement of those present. They
partake more of a social and conversational than what
would be called a religious character; opportunities for the
interchange of views in reference to Spiritual things. It
is similar to the association in Springfield, which Mr.
Munn alluded to when here. By the way, Mr. Munn has
sent me the prospectus of a weekly paper&mdash;<cite>The Spirit
Messenger</cite>, to be issued at Springfield next month. His
motive is not speculation, as any one may well judge who
knows what an up-hill business the advocacy of advanced
truth is in this our age. You and your friends in New
York must send on to him a list of subscribers. I hope it
will be sustained by the many who are seeking for light
on this and kindred subjects of deep interest. If, as intended,
it covers the field heretofore occupied by the
miraculous, it ought to be sustained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your house on Troup Street has been closed so long it
will require seeing to before you go into it. You ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to send word several days before you reach here, in order
that it may be properly ventilated. If you can do so, some
of your friends will attend to it.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;As ever, your friend,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;John E.&nbsp;R.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<h3>ARTICLE FROM A NEW YORK SUNDAY NEWSPAPER.</h3>

<p>The following is anonymous from a Sunday newspaper,
the name of which I am not now able to give:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We paid a visit on Sunday last to the Rochester ladies
(at Barnum&rsquo;s Hotel), so celebrated in this world, and in the
world of Spirits, for the extraordinary revelations made
to them through the remarkable knockings or sounds which
have excited so much attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They appear to be intelligent persons, and there is
little, if anything, in their manner that looks like simulation
or imposture. We are a perfect heretic in all such
beliefs, and never did have faith in anything that we could
not understand. As to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, or
Spirits from the other world, we have never believed in
any of them, consequently it cannot trouble us if we are
occasionally deceived; and we are seldom vexed at being
hoaxed in anything. We have attained a period of such
wonderful discoveries in science and the arts&mdash;we accomplish
so many extraordinary triumphs and unaccountable
enterprises in the present age&mdash;that our motto is &lsquo;nil
admirari.&rsquo; Let us see all that is to be seen as quickly as
possible, before we shake off this &lsquo;mortal coil.&rsquo; After
steam and the telegraph, we are ready to believe anything.
The Spirit who makes knocks for these young ladies seems
to be a familiar one, for it has followed them from Rochester
and knocks in every part of Barnum&rsquo;s Hotel, corner of
Broadway and Maiden Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The sounds, on the occasion of our visit, seemed to
proceed from several parts of the room, near the table
and in the next apartment. We thought with Hamlet,
&lsquo;Be thou a spirit of hell or goblin damned,&mdash;Bringest thou
airs from heaven or blasts from hell,&mdash;Be thy intents
wicked or charitable,&mdash;Thou com&rsquo;st in such a questionable
shape, that I will speak to thee!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first idea that struck us was to inquire of our old
friend, Tom Paine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wrote down his name and the names of several
cities, and asked where he died. The Spirits knocked &lsquo;at
New York.&rsquo; We then inquired how old he was when he
died. The familiars knocked seventy times. This was pretty
near. We asked if he voted for the death of Louis&nbsp;XVI.?
It rapped &lsquo;No.&rsquo; The old sinner! This was perplexing
and strange, yet it made no impression upon us. A clergyman
whom we have known as possessing a clear, strong
mind, brought in his pocket a family daguerrotype, and respectfully
requested the Spirits to state how many figures
were in it, when the number was rapped correctly. He then
asked how many of the six had died, and the number was
again rapped correctly. We saw the table at which we
sat and the door opposite vibrate with the knocks, and yet
we saw none that we could suspect of collusion. It is evident,
however, that the minds of all present must harmonize,
and there must be quietude and union of the nervous
fluid to develop striking and wise answers to questions&mdash;particularly
of a domestic character. The young ladies
moved about the room, apparently independent, and it was
clear that <em>they</em> were not knocking, <em>whoever was</em>; and as
to concealment and emissaries in a large bustling hotel,
with bells ringing, waiters running about, chambermaids
and lodgers constantly on the move, it is entirely out of
the question. So we came away utterly disbelieving in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
supernatural agency, and, at the same time, unable to say
how any human means could be used without detection.
The powwowings and witchcraft which prevailed so long in
New England among our ancestors are now at an end.
Our homes are no longer disturbed with an unaccountable
noise, as of old; our children do not vomit crooked pins
and tenpenny nails; nor have we either magic or sorcery.
We no longer have those spirits which the Rosicrucians
tell us inhabit the elements: sylphs, gnomes, nymphs, and
salamanders. Yet, grave and earnest men have, of old,
believed in witchcraft, and many at this day believe in this
Spiritual communion with the dead, as well as in these
mysterious knockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, however, are not of that number; but would not
censure or condemn those who are. The world is curious&mdash;these
knockings are curious&mdash;and these young ladies are
worth seeing, and the mysterious worth hearing. Then
let them pass for what they are worth.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>ARTICLE FROM THE N.&nbsp;Y. DAY-BOOK BY ITS EDITOR, R.&nbsp;N.
SIMPSON.</h3>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>The Rochester Knocking Girls.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O ho! you are all coming into it are you?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is somewhat amusing to see editors of papers, distinguished
men, literary characters and others coming into
the belief of Spiritualism, or mysterious knockings; eating
their own words and swallowing Spirits, girls, knockers
and all. We say that it is amusing&mdash;it <em>would</em> be amusing,
were it not disgusting to see men, who pretend to possess
an ordinary share of intelligence, so completely stultify
themselves&mdash;as many of these characters have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than six months ago these knockings commenced
in Rochester, and a committee, composed of the most respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
citizens of that city went into a thorough examination
of the cause of them, and reported to the world the
result of that examination. In that report they tell us all
and more than we have heard or seen since the girls have
been in this city, and conclude by exonerating the girls from
practising deception or fraud in any of their exhibitions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After reading that report, the writer of this went to
Rochester and visited the girls: the result of that visit he
published in the <cite>Day-Book</cite> with just as much expectation
of his statements being believed as if he had said that the
cars ran off the track, or that he crossed Seneca Lake on
board of a steamboat. What was his surprise to find that
not one in twenty believed a word of them. <cite>The Journal
of Commerce</cite>, <cite>The Courier</cite>, <cite>The Express</cite>, <cite>The Christian
Intelligencer</cite>, and in fact all the papers in the city amused
themselves and their readers by making fun of the whole
matter. When we met a friend he would accost us with,
&lsquo;Well, you have been to see the Rochester knockings,
have you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes sir,&rsquo; would be our answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what do you think of them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think just what I have written and published!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stimson&mdash;you don&rsquo;t pretend to believe in that humbug?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe that I heard the knockings, and that the girls
had no direct agency in making them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An incredulous stare full in the face, the cheeks filled
with wind, and a sudden bursting into a wild ironical laugh
would follow, and the friend would turn away with, &lsquo;Well,
Stimson, I am used up; if you are so easily humbugged as
that I have nothing more to say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This manifestation of utter disbelief in the whole thing,
we must acknowledge, nettled us a little, and we concluded
to &lsquo;shut up,&rsquo; and deny that we believed in anything. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
began to doubt that we had been to Rochester at all, and
as for seeing the girls or hearing the knockings, we were
ready to swear as bravely and boldly as Peter (and with
the same truth) that we knew nothing about them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, time passed on, the papers had their fun, and the
girls are here. What say <cite>The Journal of Commerce</cite> and
<cite>The Express</cite> now? Do they call it all humbug? O no!
some of our great men have been to see and hear for
themselves, and instead of calling it humbug swallow it
without gulping. Of course <cite>The Journal of Commerce</cite>
can&rsquo;t go against the great men, and <cite>The Express</cite>, never
having had an opinion of its own, follows on the back
track as tamely as an ass colt.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM DR. C.&nbsp;D. GRISWOLD, M.D.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Rappings in New York.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>To the Editor of the Evening Mirror</i>: Now that a
considerable number of &lsquo;the wise men of the East,&rsquo; even
of Gotham, have been permitted to hear the veritable
&lsquo;rappings&rsquo; which so confounded the &lsquo;foolish&rsquo; and &lsquo;credulous&rsquo;
people of the &lsquo;West,&rsquo; I do not see that they are any
more successful in discovering the machinery, wire-work,
or other means of collusion to which these phenomena
have been attributed (by those who have never witnessed
them), than were their western neighbors. All, or nearly
all those who have investigated this matter with any
honesty of purpose, have found it far exceeding their conceptions.
There is often a truthfulness and exactness in
these communications which are perfectly astounding, and
when failures do occur they can readily be accounted for
if it is admitted that they are addressed to an intelligence
which reads the most secret thoughts. What is the nature
of this intelligence which tells us our thoughts when sincere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and regards them not when called for with a trifling
or dishonest purpose? Can it be the keen-sighted perception
of the parties interested? Can it be explained by the
principles of mesmerism, or is it supernatural? These are
the questions to be answered. Those who cannot control
their thoughts from the observations of others, may be
satisfied with the first; those who do not take into consideration
the physical demonstrations, may consider the
second an explanation; but to explain all, it may be doubted,
as some do, that the power exists in the supernatural world.
This is anything but an age of reason. &lsquo;Opinion&rsquo; has gained
the ascendancy and sits upon &lsquo;reason&rsquo;s throne,&rsquo; and with
an assurance incompatible with everything but ignorance,
despises &lsquo;facts&rsquo; and evidence. Strange and mysterious as
this matter is, many of the phenomena are settled &lsquo;facts&rsquo;
which plainly contradict the vague &lsquo;opinions&rsquo; set afloat by
those who know little of what they talk or write about.
Take, for instance, a note&mdash;published in <cite>The Evening
Post</cite>&mdash;by a person who was present at the interview for
the investigation of the subject, at the rooms of Dr. Griswold,
in which he says that &lsquo;all the persons present on that
occasion (whom he has since seen) are of the opinion that
the phenomena, or knockings, were electrical, and the
answers accidental.&rsquo; These may not be his precise words,
yet they embody correctly his expression; but they are
incorrect in fact, and in their implication; as all of the
persons then present have not been consulted, far less have
they given an unanimous opinion as above expressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before any one adopts the &lsquo;opinion&rsquo; that these sounds
are electrical, would it not be well to show how they can
be produced while the three persons on whom they are attendant
are insulated several feet apart; how electricity
can be so harnessed to tables, chairs, and other things, as
to move them about, or hold them in their places so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
no human arm can stir them, or produce a concussion equal
to what would require the force of a strong arm to accomplish
and with the aid of a heavy instrument; without
saying anything of the still more wonderful manifestations
indicating intellectual direction. Any one who can give
the rationale of all this, upon electrical principles, will
undo some of the established and known laws, and discover
to the world not only the means for converting this
subtle agent into <em>an intelligent</em> motive power, but also to
give it the skill of a masterly engineer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The assumption that the correct answers given to questions
that evening&mdash;though not remarkable, comparatively&mdash;were
&lsquo;accidental,&rsquo; bears absurdity upon the face of it.
Such &lsquo;opinions&rsquo; throw no light upon the mystery, but
leave it still more inexplicable to the general intelligent
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of thousands who have now witnessed these phenomena,
almost every one at first regarded the idea that these
parties were not directly the operators, as most preposterous.
But since what is called a &lsquo;public opinion&rsquo; has become
pretty well established, the rest of the world fall in, and
see nothing very strange in them&mdash;after all. And thus it
would be with the next point, or the claim of Spirituality,
were it only understood that the immaculate judge, &lsquo;public
opinion,&rsquo; had decided in its favor. Such is the
value of <em>opinion</em> in a large sense. If the truth is told of
other days, mankind valued their opinions, and kept them
to themselves. But not so now. The article is known to
be valueless; and each one seems desirous of getting rid of
his stock. At no age of the world did <em>charlatanism</em> make
more rapid strides than it does at present; so that, it
seems, the same traits of character which render us the
subjects of deception, make us slow to embrace truth; and
for the reason, as I conceive, that &lsquo;facts&rsquo; and &lsquo;evidence&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
are less an element in the &lsquo;foundation&rsquo; of opinions than
are prejudices, preconceived notions, personal interest, and
the fear of being laughed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The philosophy of the Sunday Press upon this subject
has sustained the well-known character of those journals;
to say the least, they have been very spirited. Religion
which has been arrayed against God, is the devil&rsquo;s weapon,
and <cite>The Herald</cite> borrowed it for the first onset; &lsquo;seriously&rsquo;
fearing that this subject would be made to overthrow
the good results which sound education and true Christian
piety might accomplish. Pray, what would <cite>The Herald</cite>
have to fear from such a result? Its premises would be
exempt from any change by such a revolution, and it would,
no doubt, add to its subscription lists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one cheerful inference to be drawn from <cite>The
Herald&rsquo;s</cite> position with regard to this subject; that is, that
the devil has no meddling with the matter. By the way,
this calls to mind another distinguished individual&mdash;Dr.
David Meredith Reese&mdash;who has the advantage of a longer
name, if not quite so notorious, the great expounder of
humbugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has promised to show up the deception upon the
first opportunity, and people would have great confidence
in his experience. Come forward, doctor, and redeem
your pledge; or take back your unmanly imputations;
but, for the credit of the thing, do not say that you believe
in its verity.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM JACOB C. CUYLER.</h3>

<p>The following is from the editor of <cite>The Albany Express</cite>,
before mentioned in connection with the visit of the judges
and lawyers at Albany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Albany Morning Express Office</span>,<br />
<span class="dt">&ldquo;June 9, 1850.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;After reading an account of your meeting at the house
of the Rev. Dr. Griswold, in Broadway, New York, accompanied
as it was by many very satisfactory, and I trust convincing,
manifestations, I have experienced a species of
gratification which I can call nothing more nor less than
revengeful. Those who have scoffed and scouted the idea
of &lsquo;Spiritual communications&rsquo; were modest enough in
their prejudiced opinions to style me fanatic and chimerical;
and some, more unscrupulous than their brethren,
even hinted that no respectable paper would devote its
columns to the dissemination of such doctrines throughout
the world. But &lsquo;Truth is mighty, and will prevail.&rsquo;
Choosing rather that time should vindicate the &lsquo;Spirits,&rsquo;
than that our own feeble efforts should act as their defender,
we have waited with some anxiety the result in
New York City. When, therefore, we learned that such
men as Mr. Cooper, Mr. Tuckerman, Dr. Frances, and
others of like stamp, had received such demonstrations as
are recorded in the public journals of that city, I took
the liberty of adding some considerable to my diminutive
stature. I walked about with all the assurance of a millionaire,
and just at the nick of time, whom should I come
in contact with but the unbeliever Hastings, of <cite>The Knickerbocker</cite>.
Triumphantly I held up before his astonished
gaze the record, and exultingly asked him whether those
men were fools, lunatics, or fanatics? I had him there,
and all he could say in reply was&mdash;<em>Humbug</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was as much as I expected, and laughing at
his stubborn ignorance I left him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that even Bennett, of <cite>The Herald</cite>, has somewhat
changed his tone, and that he speaks quite favorably of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
affair. He will be compelled to do more than all this, I hope,
before long, or many weeks roll over his head. The press
generally in New York, I am happy to see, are acting very
kindly toward you, and I only wish that all may receive
entire satisfaction in their investigations. With us, all remains
as usual. Many who seemed to manifest but little
interest in the affair while you were here have, since
your departure, evinced a desire to see and investigate.
So will it be everywhere, and among all classes. The
Switch still speaks of &lsquo;Yaupy&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the Spirits with contempt;
but I believe &lsquo;Yaupy&rsquo; suffers nothing from his
efforts. He still seems to be in the enjoyment of health,
and although <em>seldom known to smile</em>, he can laugh with
more freedom than is his usual custom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think of stopping in our city before you return
to Rochester? I hope so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard that Margaretta has been unwell since
your arrival in New York, but presume her recovery is complete.
Present my kind regards to your mother and
Maggy and Catty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoping to see you in New York before you leave, I remain</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2c">Yours respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Jacob C. Cuyler.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>ARTICLE BY HORACE GREELEY, PUBLISHED IN THE TRIBUNE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Fox and her three daughters left our city yesterday
on their return to Rochester, after a stay here of some
weeks, during which they have freely subjected the mysterious
influence by which they seem to be accompanied,
to every reasonable test, and to the keen and critical scrutiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the hundreds who have chosen to visit them, or
whom they have been invited to visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rooms which they occupied at the hotel have been
repeatedly searched and scrutinized; they have been taken
without an hour&rsquo;s notice, into houses they had never before
entered; they have been, all unconsciously, placed on a
glass surface concealed under the carpet, in order to interrupt
electric vibrations; they have been disrobed by a
committee of ladies, appointed without notice, and insisting
that neither of them should leave the room until the
investigation had been made, etc., etc., yet we believe that
no one to this moment pretends that he has detected either
of them in producing or causing the &lsquo;rappings;&rsquo; nor do we
think any of their contemners has invented a plausible
theory to account for the production of these sounds, nor
the singular intelligence which (certainly at times) has
seemed to be manifested through them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some ten or twelve days since, they gave up their
rooms at the hotel, and devoted the remainder of their sojourn
here to visiting several families, to which they had
been invited by persons interested in the subject, and subjecting
the singular influence to a closer and calmer examination
than could be given to it at a hotel and before
casual companies of strangers, drawn together by a vague
curiosity, mere rational interest, or predetermined and invincible
hostility. Our own dwelling was among those thus
visited, not merely submitting to but courting the fullest and
keenest inquiry with regard to the alleged &lsquo;manifestations&rsquo;
from the Spirit world by which they were attended. We
devoted what time we could spare from our duties, out of
three days, to this subject, and it would be the basest cowardice
not to say that we are convinced beyond a doubt of <em>their
perfect integrity and good faith</em> in the premises. Whatever
may be the origin or the cause of the &lsquo;rappings,&rsquo; the ladies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
whose presence they occur do not make them. We tested
this thoroughly and to our entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their conduct and bearing is as unlike that of deceivers
as possible, and we think no one acquainted with them
could believe them at all capable of engaging in so daring,
impious, and shameful a juggle as this would be if they
caused the sounds. And it is not possible that such a juggle
should have been so long perpetrated in public, yet escape
detection. A juggler performs one feat quickly and
hurries on to another; he does not devote weeks after
weeks to doing the same thing over and over deliberately,
in full view of hundreds who sit beside or confronting him
in broad daylight, not to enjoy but to detect his trick. A
deceiver naturally avoids conversation on the subject of his
knavery, but these ladies converse freely and fully with
regard to the origin of these &lsquo;rappings&rsquo; in their dwelling
years ago, the various sensations they caused, the neighborhood
excitement created, the progress of the developments&mdash;what
they have seen, heard, and experienced from first to
last. If all were false they could not fail to have involved
themselves ere this in a labyrinth of blasting contradictions,
as each separately gives accounts of the most astounding
occurrences at this or that time. Persons foolish enough so
to commit themselves without reserve or caution could not
have deferred a thorough self-exposure for a single week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course a variety of opinions of so strange a matter
would naturally be formed by the various persons who
have visited them, and we presume those who have merely
run into their room for an hour or so and listened, among
a huddle of strangers, to a medley of questions&mdash;not all
admitting of very profitable answers&mdash;put to certain invisible
intelligencies and answered by rappings or singular
noises on the floor, table, etc., as the alphabet was called
over or otherwise, would naturally go away perhaps puzzled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
probably disgusted, rarely convinced. It is hardly
possible that a matter ostensibly so grave could be presented
under circumstances less favorable to conviction.
But of those who have enjoyed proper opportunities for a
full investigation we believe that fully three-fourths are
convinced, as we are, that these singular sounds and seeming
manifestations are not produced by Mrs. Fox and
her daughters, nor by any human being connected with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How they <em>are</em> caused, and whence they proceed, are
questions which open a much wider field of inquiry, with
whose way-marks we do not profess to be familiar. He
must be well acquainted with the arcana of the universe
who shall presume dogmatically to decide that these manifestations
are natural or supernatural. The ladies say that
they are informed that this is but the beginning of a new
era or economy, in which Spirits clothed in flesh are to be
more closely and palpably connected with those which
have put on immortality; that the manifestations have already
appeared in many other families and are destined to
be diffused and rendered clearer, until all who will may
communicate freely and beneficially with their friends who
have &lsquo;shuffled off this mortal coil.&rsquo; Of all this we know
nothing and shall guess nothing. But if we were simply
to print (which we shall not) the questions we asked and
the answers we received during a two hours&rsquo; uninterrupted
conference with the &lsquo;rappers,&rsquo; we should at once be accused
of having done so expressly to sustain the theory
which regards these manifestations as the utterances of
departed spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe it is the intention of the ladies to shun
henceforth all publicity or notoriety as far as possible.
They do not expect or wish to make gain of the &lsquo;Rappings;&rsquo;
they have desired to vindicate their own characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from the gross imputations so freely cast upon them;
believing that, that effected, they hope to be permitted
hereafter to live in that seclusion which befits their sex,
their station, and their wishes. We trust they may be permitted
to do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">BUFFALO. 1850-51.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Urged to return to New York&mdash;Visit to Buffalo&mdash;Attempt
by a Pretended Friend to Frighten us away&mdash;Thunderbolt
from the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser&mdash;The
&ldquo;Females&rdquo;&mdash;Knee-joint Theory&mdash;Our Reply Challenging
Investigation of it&mdash;The Doctors&rsquo; Day&mdash;Mrs. Patchen&rsquo;s
Peculiarity.</p>


<p>We all returned to our home in Rochester, but immediately
started for the old homestead (Arcadia, Wayne
County), where for about a month we enjoyed the society
of our dear friends to our hearts&rsquo; content. After this it
became necessary to go back to Rochester, where we received
urgent letters from New York, insisting on our
return to that city, now that we had had what our friends
there thought a sufficient period of repose and holiday.
These invitations we refused, whatever might be the conditions
offered; but this soon brought upon us a visit of
Judge Edmonds and others, <em>in person</em>, who insisted, in
the name of all our friends, as well as in that of our
&ldquo;duty,&rdquo; that some of the family at least should return
with him to New York. This finally led, after much persuasion
and deliberation, to our consent that Katie, accompanied
of course by mother, should do so, and Maggie
remained with me at my house in Troup Street, Rochester.
At New York mother and Katie were to reside successively
with our principal friends in the great city.</p>

<p>We left Rochester for Buffalo the 16th of December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
1850, at the earnest solicitation of many friends there.
It was our intention on leaving home to be absent about
two weeks, but, like the Spirits, we could not calculate our
time. When we had been there about two weeks, we
began to think of turning our steps homeward; but our
friends would not consent to our leaving them so soon, as
the crowded séances and the continued increasing interest
seemed to demand our presence still longer. We remained,
and soon found why we were detained. About this time
two of the Buffalo doctors called on us, viz., Dr. C.&nbsp;B.
Coventry and Dr. Charles A. Lee. To my certain knowledge,
Dr. Austin Flint never appeared in our presence
until after he had made the wonderful discovery of &ldquo;knee-ology,&rdquo;
which is fully explained hereafter. Dr. Coventry
appeared gentlemanly at all times and places; but Dr. Lee
proved himself to be a wily, deceitful man. He certainly
professed, to us, to be greatly surprised at what he witnessed
in our presence; and I was myself afterward surprised
at the manner and tone of the subsequent attacks
upon us in which he united.</p>

<p>The first intimation we had of the thunderbolt which
was being forged to be hurled upon us by the Buffalo
doctors, from what they seemed to consider as an Olympic
height of professional authority, was a visit which I received
one morning from Dr. T.&nbsp;M. Foote, formerly U.&nbsp;S.
Minister to Bogota, and at this time editor of <cite>The Buffalo
Commercial Advertiser</cite>. He professed to come as our
friend, and with a gentle blandness and confidential tone
advised me to leave Buffalo at once, suggesting that the first
train would leave in about two hours; that the whole thing
was now found out and exposed, and that he came to save
us from being mobbed out of the city. I suppose now
that our oily friend in his own evil heart imagined us to be
really frauds, and that I would probably be frightened into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
flight; or, at any rate, give evidence of conscious guilt in
the mode of receiving such a friendly warning. For a
moment or two I scarcely understood his meaning; but
then I asked, with my best haughtiness, what right he had
to come to my door, at our private hours, without sending
up his card; and I stepped back into my room, shutting
and locking the door in his face, and at once rang the bell,
more violently than was perhaps lady-like, but so as to
bring the porter very promptly to the door, near which my
visitor was still standing. I told the porter to beg Mr.
Rogers, the good and kind proprietor of the house, to step
up, and to him I complained that <em>that man</em> had dared to
come to my door, within my private hours, without first
sending up his card for permission; that he had insulted
me, and that I begged he might never be admitted again
under any circumstances. Of course I knew well enough
who &ldquo;that man&rdquo; was, for he had often been at our rooms,
and had entertained us with stories of the tricks of legerdemain
he had witnessed in South America. He was here
an important and potent personage, being an ex-diplomatist
and editor of an evening paper. From his other title, I
suppose he must once have also been of the same profession
as the three M.D.&rsquo;s whose attack on us was already in
type in his columns, as I soon afterward knew by the news-boys&rsquo;
cries of &ldquo;The Rochester Knockings! Great Exposure
of the Rochester Knockings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the Rochester knockings were an imposture, nobody
was more imposed upon by them than myself, and nobody
could have had a greater interest in learning how they
were produced. I therefore sent out to buy a copy of <cite>The
Commercial Advertiser</cite> of February 18, 1851, still damp
from the press, in which I read the following authoritative
scientific account of the way in which, for now nearly three
years, my little sisters and myself had been wearing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
our knee-bones to impose upon the world, our family, and
ourselves! And this is what I read:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To the Editor of</span> <cite>The Commercial Advertiser</cite>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curiosity having led us to visit the rooms at the Phelps
House in which two females from Rochester&mdash;Mrs. Fish
and Miss Fox&mdash;profess to exhibit striking manifestations
from the Spirit world, by means of which communion
may be had with deceased friends, etc.; and having arrived
at a physiological explanation of the phenomena, the
correctness of which has been demonstrated in an instance
which has since fallen under our observation, we have felt
that a public statement is called for which may perhaps
serve to prevent a further waste of time, money, and credulity
(to say nothing of sentiment and philosophy) in connection
with this so long successful imposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The explanation is reached, almost by a logical necessity,
on the application of a method of reasoning much resorted
to in the diagnosis of diseases&mdash;namely, <em>the reasoning
by exclusion</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was reached by this method prior to the demonstration
which has subsequently occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be assumed, first, that the manifestations are not
to be regarded as spiritual, provided they can be physically
or physiologically accounted for. Immaterial agencies are
not to be invoked until material agencies fail. We are
thus to <em>exclude</em> Spiritual causation in this stage of the investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next, it is taken for granted that the <em>rappings</em> are not
produced by artificial contrivances about the persons of the
females, which may be concealed by the dress. This
hypothesis is excluded because it is understood that the females
have been repeatedly and carefully examined by lady
committees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is obvious that the rappings are not caused by machinery
attached to tables, doors, etc., for they are heard
in different rooms, and in different parts of the same room
in which the females are present, but always near the spot
where the females are stationed. This mechanical hypothesis
is then to be excluded. So much for negative evidence,
and now for what positively relates to the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On carefully observing the countenances of the two
females it is evident that they involve an effort of the will.
They evidently attempted to conceal any indications of
voluntary effort, but did not succeed. A voluntary effort
was manifested, and it was plain that it could not be continued
very long without fatigue. Assuming, then, this
<em>positive fact</em>, the inquiry arises, how can the will be exerted
to produce sounds (rappings) without obvious movements
of the body? The voluntary muscles themselves
are the only organs, save those which belong to the mind
itself, over which volition can exercise any direct control.
But contractions of the muscles do not, in the muscles
themselves, occasion obvious sounds. The muscles, therefore,
to develop audible vibrations, must act upon parts
with which they are connected. Now, it was sufficiently
clear that the rappings were not <em>vocal</em> sounds; these could
not be produced without movements of the respiratory
muscles, which would at once lead to detection. Hence,
excluding vocal sounds, the only <em>possible</em> source of the
noises in question, produced as we have seen they must
be, by voluntary muscular contractions, is in one or more
of the movable articulations of the skeleton, from the anatomical
construction of the voluntary muscles. This
explanation remains as the <em>only alternative</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By an analysis prosecuted in this manner we arrive at
the conviction that the <em>rappings</em>, assuming that they are
not spiritual, are produced by the action of the will,
through voluntary action on the joints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Various facts may be cited to show that the motion of
the joints, under certain circumstances, is adequate to produce
the phenomena of the rappings; but we need not
now refer to these. By a curious coincidence, after arriving
at the above conclusion respecting the source of the
sounds, an instance has fallen under our observation, which
demonstrates the fact that noises precisely identical with
the <em>spiritual rappings</em> may be produced in the <em>knee-joints</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A highly respectable lady of this city possesses the
ability of developing sounds similar, both in character and
degree, to those professedly elicited, by the Rochester impostors,
from the Spirit world. We have witnessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
production of the sounds by the lady referred to, and have
been permitted to examine the mechanism by which they
are produced. Without entering at this time into a very
minute anatomical and physiological explanation, it is sufficient
to state that the muscles inserted into the upper and
inner side of the large bone of the leg (the tibia), near the
knee-joint, are brought into action so as to move the upper
surface of the bone just named laterally upon the lower
surface of the thigh bone (the femur), giving rise, in fact,
to a partial lateral dislocation.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This is effected by an act
of the will, without any obvious movement of the limb,
occasioning a loud noise, and the return of the bone to its
place is attended by a second sound. Most of the Rochester
rappings are double. It is practicable, however, to
produce a single sound by moving the bone out of place
with the requisite quickness and force, and allowing it to
slide slowly back, in which case it is noiseless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The visible vibrations of articles in the room, situated
near the operator, occur, if the limb, or any portion of the
body, is in contact with them at the time the sounds are
produced. The force of the semi-dislocation of the bone
is sufficient to occasion distinct jarring of the doors, tables,
etc., if in contact. The intensity of the sound may be
varied in proportion to the force of the muscular contractions,
and this will render the apparent source of the rappings
more or less distinct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have witnessed repetitions of experiments, in the
case just referred to, sufficient to exhibit to us all the
phenomena of the sounds belonging to the Rochester rappings,
and, without further explanations at this time, we
append our names in testimony of the facts contained in
the foregoing hastily penned exposition.</p>

<p>I had been so indignant at Dr. Foote&rsquo;s first intimation
to me of what was coming, that if, when I slammed the
door in his face, it had happened to come in contact with
his nose, which he had so impertinently and hypocritically
attempted to intrude into our rooms, I fear I should not
have much regretted the accident; but anger evaporated
over the perusal of this precious scientific performance;
which was certainly enough to make me smile aloud over
its absurdity. I saw at once that we could have nothing
to fear from it, even though, at the first blush, its solemn
professional air and tone might impose upon the ignorant
and gratify the bigotry of some hostilities. I knew that
the first sincere investigation, with special reference to
this new and comical knee-joint theory, must at once explode
it and cover its authors with confusion. I published
the next day, in all the daily papers, the following card.
It will be remembered that I was now alone in Buffalo
with Maggie; mother and Katie being at New York.</p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Doctors Flint, Coventry</span>, and <span class="smcap">Lee</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;We observe, by a communication in
<cite>The Commercial Advertiser</cite>, that you have recently made
an examination of a &lsquo;highly respectable lady of this city,&rsquo;
by which you have discovered the secret of the &lsquo;Rochester
impostors.&rsquo; As we do not feel willing to rest under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the imputation of being impostors, we are very willing
to undergo a proper and decent examination, provided
we can select three male and three female friends who
shall be present on the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can assure the public that there is no one more
anxious than ourselves to discover the origin of these mysterious
manifestations. If they can be explained on &lsquo;anatomical
and physiological&rsquo; principles, it is due to the world
that the investigation be made, and that the &lsquo;humbug&rsquo; be
exposed. As there seems to be much interest manifested
by the public on that subject, we would suggest that as
early an investigation as is convenient would be acceptable
to the undersigned.</p>

<p class="sgn1">&ldquo;A. Leah Fish.<br />
&ldquo;Margaretta Fox.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="cl">The learned professors, being thus challenged, could do
no less than accept, and a meeting was arranged, which
took place at the Phelps House. Indeed, for the next
fortnight we may be said to have surrendered our whole
time to investigations, our rooms being open freely and
gratuitously to meetings of the public, or of committees
appointed by them, consisting of gentlemen selected from
&ldquo;the pick&rdquo; of Buffalo. The three doctors had the first
evening in their own hands; though there were present
Mr. Rogers, the proprietor of the hotel, and I think two
or three gentlemen friendly to us, and many other promiscuous
gentlemen. I remember particularly the presence
of two steamboat men (idle, of course, at that season),
Captains Rounds and Walker. This is fixed in my recollection
because of a little incident in regard to which I
have never been sure which of them was the (kindly)
guilty party. They both felt a pity&mdash;natural to good
and kindly men&mdash;for two young creatures thus baited, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it were by cruel enemies; and as we, Maggie and I, sat
together on a sofa, and after long waiting no raps came,
one of them rested his arm on the back of the sofa and
actually, with his knuckles, made behind me three raps
which were not a bad imitation. Perhaps he was not
more than half conscious of what he did, like the boy
who denied that he had whistled in school and said &ldquo;it
whistled itself.&rdquo; But I knew the raps not to be genuine;
while the kindness of heart of the author of them at
such a moment of trial excited in me something perhaps
a little hysterical, for I cried, or rather sobbed out&mdash;&ldquo;O,
for pity&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t do that. If God and the good
Spirits have deserted us we will abide the consequences;
but don&rsquo;t let there be any false rapping.&rdquo; Good Mr.
Rogers was so much moved and excited (he had been before
wiping streams of perspiration from his forehead)
that he staggered as he stood, and some friends assisted
him out of the room; and I understood that he actually
fainted.</p>

<p>But the good Spirits had inspired me well; for I was
afterward told that it produced the best effect on all present.
From this I presume that I must except the doctors,
whom professional dignity and pride committed to their
new theory; and who, probably under the materialistic
bigotry of modern science, were all in arms against us
and the Spirits. The spontaneous genuineness of it was
clear evidence that there was nothing but honesty in us,
whatever mystery might be under these strange manifestations&mdash;mysterious
to ourselves first and most of all.</p>

<p>It was certainly a severe and cruel ordeal for us, as we
sat there under that accusation, surrounded by all these
men, authorities, some of them persecutors, while the
raps, usually so ready and familiar, would not come to our
relief. Some few and faint ones did indeed come&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
nine or ten. The doctors say in their account that it was
while they intermitted the holding of our feet. Such was
not my impression, but I attach small importance to that.
It will be seen herein that the first <em>Doctors&rsquo; day</em> was followed
by many more, in the presence of committees of all
that was highest and best of authority in Buffalo, in which
not only did the raps abound, alike when our feet and
knees were held and when they were not, but other manifestations
of the presence and action of our Spirit-friends
which far transcended the significancy of raps. We are
now familiar with the fact that Spirits often refuse to act
in the presence of those who bring to the occasion, not a
candid and fair spirit of inquiry for the satisfaction of an
honest scepticism, but a bitter and offensive bigotry of
prejudice and invincible hostility, which does not really
seek, but rather repels the truth, and but little deserves
the favor of its exhibition to them by the Spirits.</p>

<p>Neither men nor Spirits care always to cast their pearls
away upon unfit and unworthy recipients. Our Spirits
knew well what they could and would exhibit on the following
days to the public of Buffalo and the world, through
better channels of higher authority.</p>

<p>The three doctors published their account, the animus
of which appears in the one circumstance that we are never
mentioned but as &ldquo;females&rdquo;&mdash;a small fact, but enough to
show how some males may be M.D.&rsquo;s without being gentlemen.</p>

<p>The following extracts from their account of it will present
the whole of its substance:</p>

<div class="blockquo2">
<p>&ldquo;The two females were seated upon two chairs placed
near together, their heels resting on cushions, their lower
limbs extended, with the toes elevated and the feet separated
from each other. The object of this experiment was
to secure a position in which the ligaments of the knee-joint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
should be made tense, and no opportunity offered to
make a pressure with the foot. We were pretty well
satisfied that the displacement of the bones requisite for
the sounds could not be effected, unless a fulcrum were
obtained by resting one foot upon the other, or on some
resisting body. The company waited half an hour, but no
sounds were heard in this position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The position of the younger sister was then changed
to a sitting posture, with lower limbs extended on the sofa,
the elder sister sitting, in the customary way, at the other
extremity of the sofa. The &lsquo;Spirits&rsquo; did not choose to
signify their presence under these circumstances, although
repeatedly requested so to do. The latter experiment
went to confirm the belief that the younger sister alone
produced the rapping. These experiments were continued
until the females themselves admitted that it was useless
to continue any longer at that time, with any expectation
of <em>manifestations</em> being made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In resuming the usual position on the sofa, the feet
resting on the floor, the <em>knockings</em> soon began to be heard.
It was then suggested that some other experiments be
made. This was assented to, notwithstanding the first was
to our minds amply conclusive. The experiment selected
was, that the knees of the two females be firmly grasped,
with the hands so applied that any lateral movement of
the bones would be perceptible to the touch. The pressure
was made through the dress. It was not expected to
prevent the sounds, but to ascertain if they proceeded from
the knee-joint. It is obvious that this experiment was far
less demonstrative to an observer than the first, because, if
the bones were distinctly felt to move, the only evidence
of this fact would be the testimony of those whose hands
were in contact with them. The hands were kept in
apposition for several minutes at a time, and the experiments
repeated frequently, for the space of half an hour
or more, with negative results; that is to say, there were
plenty of <em>raps</em> when the knees were not held, and none
when the hands were applied, save once; as the pressure
was intentionally somewhat relaxed (Dr. Lee being the
holder) two or three faint single <em>raps</em> were heard, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Lee immediately averred that the motion of the bone was
plainly perceptible to him. The experiment of seizing the
knees as quickly as possible, when the knocking first commenced,
was tried several times, but always with the
effect of putting an immediate <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">quietus</em> upon the <em>demonstrations</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proposition to bandage the knees was discussed.
The experiment was objected to, on the part of the friends
of the females, unless we could concede that it should be
a conclusive test experiment. We were not prepared with
appliances to render the limb immovable, and therefore
declined to have it considered such a test.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the experiment anticipated, and one which, we
presume, the females thought would end in their triumph.
A bandage applied above and below the patella, admitting
of flexion of the limb, will probably prevent the displacement,
as we have but little doubt had been ascertained by
the Rochester females before an examination was invited.
Should it become necessary to repeat experiments in other
places, in furtherance of the explosion of the imposition,
we would suggest that the bandage be not relied upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had our experiments, which were first directed to this
joint, failed, we should have proceeded to interrogate, experimentally,
other articulations. But the conclusion
seemed clear that the <cite>Rochester Knockings</cite> emanate from
the knee-joint.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The name of the lady referred to, who had some extraordinary
formation of the joint in one of her knees, was
Mrs. Patchen. (At the close of this chapter the reader will
find some letters from her to me.) She could produce a
peculiar, unpleasant, crunching sound by pressing her knee
forward against some resisting object, and then kicking, as
it were, upward her foot by a movement which lifted her
dress and was obviously visible to persons present. But
it was with great effort and very painful to herself, and
the consequence of her having exhibited it to a committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
at our rooms was that she was confined for about a week.
The way her peculiar case had come to their knowledge
was this: One night, when her husband had returned late
from one of our meetings and stated the cause of his delay,
she told him, in joke, that she could make raps with her
knee-joint, and that he should rather pay her than us.
She could also make them in bed, having a side-board on
which she could press the knee. The next day her husband
mentioned this to Dr. Austin Flint, who happened
to be his family physician. The medical eagerness to
rush forth with their address to the public above quoted,
with little if any investigation, is shown by the fact that
it was on the following day that the scientific tirade
against us, signed by the three doctors, appeared in <cite>The
Commercial Advertiser</cite>. It is most charitable to suppose
that they never really heard Mrs. Patchen&rsquo;s peculiar sound,
because it was manifest to all who afterward heard it at
our rooms, that it bore no resemblance to the knocking of
our invisible friends, since otherwise there is no escape
from a still more discreditable alternative.</p>

<p>Mrs. Patchen was greatly annoyed at the use to which
this rare peculiarity of hers had been perverted. She
came to see me and expressed her deep regret, even before
we recognized each other as old school-mates; and the following
letters, written after she had heard and witnessed
for herself (the originals of which I still possess), sufficiently
speak for themselves. The date of the doctors&rsquo; attack was
February 18, 1851.</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>, March 8, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs. Fish:</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you and your sister possibly make it convenient
to come to my house this afternoon? If not, do come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
this evening without fail. You will confer a great favor
by so doing. I want to see you both very much.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Your ever dear friend,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Mrs. Patchen.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. I did not send your little satchel, as I wanted you
to come and see me yourself. Please send an answer by
the little boy.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, March 21, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friends, Mrs. Fish and Sister</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been anxiously waiting to see you at our home
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Phelps House is so crowded I could not see you
privately for a moment. I do want to see you very much.
I have heard so much of your &lsquo;manifestations&rsquo;&mdash;not yours,
but the manifestations of the Spirits. They are very
mysterious; it is very singular. My husband was at your
rooms last evening, but he thought it not best for me to
come in such a crowd. I wish you could disengage yourselves
for one afternoon or evening as soon as you possibly
can. I never before felt so deeply interested in the subject.
I cannot possibly wait a week. Please send word
when you will come.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Mrs. Patchen.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>This is the lady through whom Dr. Flint endeavored to
expose us to the world as humbugs and impostors.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This article was also published in the Buffalo Medical Journal for
March, 1851, with a note saying that the <em>editor</em> had <em>taken the liberty</em> to
&ldquo;correct an error in the account of the displacement of the joint which
produces the sounds.&rdquo; That correction was of the sentence we have
italicized, and the editorial correction reads as follows:
</p><p>
&ldquo;Without entering, at this time, into minute anatomical and physiological
explanation, it is sufficient to state that, <i>owing to relaxation of
the ligaments of the knee-joint, by means of muscular action and pressure
of the lower extremity against a point of resistance, the large bone of the
leg</i> (the tibia) is moved laterally upon the lower surface of the thigh bone
(the femur), giving rise, in fact, to partial lateral dislocation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
By comparing the portion italicized, in this note especially, it will be
seen that the &ldquo;doctors disagreed&rdquo; very materially, making, in fact, two
different statements.</p></div>

<p>But the three doctors were not to have it all their own
way&mdash;not even with the assistance of a fourth, who was
now the ex-diplomatic editor of their organ, and whom I
spare from mention of what had been, in former times,
his last exercise in Buffalo of the honorable profession to
which he had been of but little honor. Whether he is
still living in the flesh, or has gone to learn for himself,
in the Spirit world, all the truth of Spiritualism, I do not
know. They had put all Buffalo on the boil, and our
rooms were crowded with hosts of indignant friends. For
about a fortnight they were open and free to the public,
without money and without price, whenever fresh parties
came or were brought who desired satisfaction on any
point glowing out of the then raging doctoral controversy.
Different committees of investigation and re-investigation
were appointed, for which services the first and best men
and women of Buffalo would be chosen. I will particularize
two, with omission of some merely prefatory matter
from the second of the two, the reports of which are taken
from Mr. Capron&rsquo;s book, quoting from the Buffalo papers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>


<h3>A MEETING AT THE PHELPS HOUSE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;A company, consisting of J.&nbsp;L. Reynolds, F. Rumsey,
Dr. W.&nbsp;R. Scott, H. Cummings, Dr. G.&nbsp;E. Hayes, Capt.
A. Walker, C.&nbsp;C. Bristol, James Dunkin and wife, J.&nbsp;S.
Chadwick, S. Albro, and J. Stringham, met at the rooms
of Mrs. Fish and Miss Fox, at seven and a half o&rsquo;clock
last Monday evening. Two large hand-bells and one
small one had been provided for Spirits to manifest their
presence with, if they should choose to make use of them.
The bells were placed under the table, and the company
were seated. Rappings immediately commenced, manifesting
the presence of the representatives of the Spirit-country.
We resolved to ask no questions, and wait for
voluntary manifestations. Alphabet called, spelling, &lsquo;Sit
close, and you may see some new manifestations.&rsquo; All
drew near the table, and waited in silence. After waiting
some time, the small bell commenced ringing. The mediums&rsquo;
feet had been placed in the custody of two gentlemen
who had not been there before, and their hands were
continually on the table. The largest bell now commenced
ringing, and, while ringing, moved &rsquo;round, traversing the
whole area under the table. Two bells rang at once. Afterward
the whole three united in a kind of chime. The
largest bell was placed on Dr. Hayes&rsquo;s foot, and bore on it
with a pressure of six times its weight. He put his hand
down and touched the bell. He received other manifestations
in the presence of an active agent. The medium
told him to ask if it was a Spirit. He did so, and was
answered by a pinch of his toe, signifying the affirmative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it the Spirit of my brother?&rsquo; <em>Answer</em>, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
He wrote the names of his deceased brothers, and it designated
its own name by pinching his toe. &lsquo;Does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Spirit wish to communicate with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will communicate
with you at home, when all is calm.&rsquo; Here silence
prevailed for a time. The bells commenced ringing, and
occasionally one would fall upon the floor. Alphabet
called, spelling, &lsquo;Move back a little from the table.&rsquo; All
moved back except Capt. Walker, who made several efforts
to obey, but found his chair fast. He looked to see
if it was not fast in the carpet, and tried to raise it, but it
refused to move upward, backward or forward. Alphabet
called, spelling, &lsquo;Sit close to the table.&rsquo; All drew
their chairs close to the table, and Capt. Walker embraced
the opportunity to see if the order had not loosened his
chair; but he could not stir it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the Spirit commenced performances with bells;
sometimes ringing them all at once, and sometimes placing
them on the feet of one, and on the knees of another.
Sometimes they would fall on the floor, and sometimes
hit the under side of the table. This ceased, the alphabet
was called, and the spelling was, &lsquo;Look.&rsquo; We looked, and
the three bells stood in a right line, about eighteen inches
apart. We resumed our positions, and the operations of
ringing, pressing feet, and throwing down bells, went on
again. Again we were called to &lsquo;look,&rsquo; and the two large
bells stood upright, but the small one was missing, and
could not be found. One of the company suggested that
we look under the larger bells. The largest bell was
lifted, and the missing one was found under it, standing
erect. The play then went on, till we were again told to
&lsquo;look,&rsquo; and the small bell was found under the large one,
lying on its side. So it continued for some time, placing
the bells in various positions, and calling on the company
to &lsquo;look.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In answer to a question asked some days previously,&mdash;&lsquo;What
is the use of these demonstrations?&rsquo; the Spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
said, &lsquo;They are made to prove that the mediums have no
agency in it.&rsquo; And the question asked by Mr. Stringham,
&lsquo;May I leave the table while the others remain, that I
may look under and see the bells ringing?&rsquo; was answered,
&lsquo;What do you think we require you to sit close to the
table for?&rsquo; When Spirits make these physical demonstrations
they are compelled to assume shapes which human
eyes must not look upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the above-named performances were finished,
loud concussions were heard and felt on the under side of
the table. They became louder and louder, till the brass
candlesticks were made to bound up six or eight inches
from the table. The candles were repeatedly thrown out
of them, and we were compelled to hold them in our
hands. These concussions were equal to those a man
could make with a large nail-hammer, while lying on his
back and striking with all his strength. We expected the
bed of the table to be split in pieces, and Mrs. Fish became
alarmed, turned pale, and begged us to leave the table.
We did not comply, and the concussions were continued
for full fifteen minutes. At the close of this very noisy exhibition,
the alphabet was called for, and the spelling was,
&lsquo;We are all done for to-night.&rsquo; They were not importuned
to continue the performances, and we arose from the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The table was turned up to see what impressions were
made, and a great number of deep indentations, in the
hard cherry-wood, manifested the force with which the
middle-sized bell had been thrust against it. Dr. Hayes
took the bell and struck the table with the battered iron
point which comes through the wooden handle, and made
like indentations, though nothing like so deep as those
made by the performers. Any one might have examined
the table, and found the evidence.</p>

<p>This, coming as it did from, and being endorsed by, respectable
citizens, was a strong opposing argument against
the knee-joint theory. Every one could see that either
these persons had formed a conspiracy to deceive the public,
or the professors were proved to be the &ldquo;humbugs&rdquo;
themselves. Still another report appeared in a few days,
which rendered the explanation of the professors still more
ridiculous. It was from the pen of a well-known citizen of
Buffalo, who had been appointed by a company to prepare
it. I give it as it appeared in one of the Buffalo papers.</p>


<h3>SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Maynard</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having been deputed by a select company, who visited
the two sisters, Mrs. Fish and Miss Fox, at their room in
the Phelps House, on Friday evening last, to report what
we there saw and heard, it becomes my duty to ask you to
give place to this communication in your columns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The company consisted of Dr. Scott, C.&nbsp;C. Bristol, J.
Stringham, F. Rumsey and lady, Mrs. Bradley, Mrs.
Stevens, and myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When all had assembled we took seats around the table.
Mrs. Fish and Miss Fox, the two &lsquo;mediums,&rsquo; were requested
to take seats on a sofa which stood between the table and
the wall. Dr. Scott and myself were seated, by arrangement,
on the right and left of these two ladies, and they
were requested to put their feet on ours, and to keep them
there, which they did. The purpose of this arrangement
will be understood by the reader. When all was still, the
Spirits (I use the word assentingly) commenced such a
clatter of rappings that there seemed to be quite a company
of them. This, we were told, was to manifest their
presence and their willingness to be consulted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The confusion of sounds ceased, and the alphabet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
called for by five distinct raps, which it appears is the
invariable signal. Mrs. Fish called the alphabet, and the
letters designated by the rappings made the following
words: &lsquo;Get a better supply of paper before you get engaged,
and let your minds run in one perfect channel. In
that way you will soon be able to get satisfactory demonstrations.&rsquo;
A supply of paper was procured, and all were
seated and still again. Two small bells had been placed
under the table, one at each end. When all was quiet,
the signal for the alphabet was given, and the spelling
which followed was, &lsquo;All sit close to the table and to
each other. Move the bells.&rsquo; The bells were then moved
to near the centre of the table. Alphabet called again.
&lsquo;Put your hands on the table.&rsquo; All obeyed the mandate,
and immediately the bells commenced ringing. They
rang for a few minutes, and again the alphabet was demanded.
The spelling was, &lsquo;You will perceive, by what
you have already heard, that a great and mighty development
is about to be made to mankind.&rsquo; At this moment
a rap was heard at the door, which was made by a gentleman
who wished to come in, but who retired on being informed
that it was a private party. Some remark was
made by the younger of the two mediums, in relation to
the interruption, which affected the other to tears. A
considerable interval of silence followed, and we began to
fear that our entertainment would not be resumed; but
the call for the alphabet proved that we had not been
deserted by our invisible friends. The spelling was, &lsquo;We
want you to cheer up, dear children. All sit close. Hands
on the table.&rsquo; Now the bells commenced ringing again,
moving all round under the table, giving forth tones the
most musical, mellow, and soothing. The ringing ceased,
and the alphabet was called. The spelling was, &lsquo;This is
done to harmonize you all.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Question by the acting medium.</em>&mdash;&lsquo;Do the Spirits wish
us to be in a happy state of mind?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Answer.</em>&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Then followed, &lsquo;I want you all to
reach out your feet, except the four on the sofa.&rsquo; This was
done, and immediately Mrs. Stevens said something had
taken hold of her feet. She was directed to ask if it was
a Spirit, which she did, and received an affirmative answer.
&lsquo;Is it the Spirit of my father?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; was replied, and
the respondent continued, &lsquo;we are glad you came here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Following this was a harsh, grating sound, not unlike
the friction of a saw which is pushed slowly through a
board, and drawn back quickly. This was continued but
a short time, when the alphabet was called for, and the
spelling was, &lsquo;I breathed so when I was dying.&rsquo; Then
the same sound of grating was heard, and it continued like
one laboring in the last moments of life. These breathings
became shorter and further between, till a seemingly
ineffectual attempt, like a hiccough, closed the drama, and
the death-scene was complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hereupon the alphabet was called for, and the following
address was spelled: &lsquo;Such is the end of man&rsquo;s existence
on the earth; but he suddenly awakes to a glorious
immortality. This, my dear friends, is demonstrated to
relieve mankind from the dread of changing existence.
The appearance of suffering is not real; therefore I exhort
you to look forward with joy for the happy transition
from earth to heaven. You have need of great watchfulness
and care that you may be permitted to enter the
society of the blest. Done.&rsquo; What was very remarkable
in the delivery of this address, as the medium read the
alphabet, the letters were designated sometimes by raps,
as usual, and sometimes by ringing of a bell. The latter
method was used, I think, quite as much as the former.
During the whole delivery the feet of the lady-mediums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
rested entirely on those of Dr. Scott and mine, and their
hands constantly rested on the table. This, as it seems to
me, puts to rest any question of their agency in producing
the sounds. Mrs. Stevens, during the whole of the communication
by &lsquo;Spirits,&rsquo; felt a pair of large and powerful
hands grasping her knees, the pressure of which, she
avers, was quite painful. She also felt a weight in her
lap, which was equal to that of her father while living.
His name was Asa Ranson. The female portrait which
hangs in the Common Council room is that of his daughter,
and a sister of Mrs. Stevens. The latter lady says
that the death scene which was enacted in our presence
was a perfect representation of the reality which she had
witnessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the conclusion of the address, it was asked by the
acting medium, &lsquo;Are the Spirits <em>all</em> done?&rsquo; No reply
was made. It was then asked, &lsquo;If we put paper under
the table, will the Spirits write?&rsquo; <em>Answer by the alphabet</em>,
&lsquo;We will make marks on paper.&rsquo; A piece of paper was
then taken and passed around, to be examined by the company.
All saw that it was without mark or scratch of any
kind. A scratching sound was then heard under the table,
and also the sound that is noted when paper is torn. The
alphabet was called, and the spelling was, &lsquo;Look.&rsquo; The
paper was taken out, and found to be torn in pieces and
scratched as with a nail, or some dull instrument. It was
then asked, &lsquo;If we put paper and pencil under, will the
Spirits write?&rsquo; Three raps were given as answer in the
affirmative, and the alphabet was called. The spelling was,
&lsquo;Keep your pencil.&rsquo; Another piece of paper was then
handed round. We all examined it closely, and found it
all fair and clean, without the least mark whatever. It was
put under the table by the last examiner, and the scratching
commenced. Directly the alphabet was called for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and &lsquo;Look&rsquo; spelled out. The paper was taken out, and
found to be scratched as before, and torn a little; but the
Spirit had fulfilled its promise. It had written&mdash;for the
figure 7 in plain pencil-mark stood on the untorn part of
it. The figure was found to be just one inch long, and
seemed as if made by the hand of a farmer, or mechanic,
who aimed at plainness rather than elegance in his chirography.
I have the paper in my possession, and will exhibit
it to any one who wishes to see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten to mention that during the communications
from Mrs. Stevens&rsquo;s father, she read the alphabet
part of the time, and received answers by a rap on her
foot. She was too much excited to continue, and the alphabet
was read by the medium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the last paper was brought out from under the
table, we all expressed a desire to know what was meant
by the character 7. Our deliberations on that subject were
soon cut short by a call for the alphabet, and the meaning
was spelled out as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seven of this party will be mediums. Do not ask
which. We are done for to-night.&rsquo; <em>Question.</em> &lsquo;Will the
Spirits answer no more questions?&rsquo; <em>Answer.</em> &lsquo;We are
done for to-night. Move away from the table.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were many other incidents during the sitting.
The lady-medium who sat next to Dr. Scott had her dress
pulled and held fast, and she invited the doctor to try and
see if he could release it. He made a strong effort, but
gave it up for fear of tearing it. Several others had their
feet handled and their clothes pulled. I felt a palpable
pressure against the inside of my leg, and a pinch of my
ankle, while a bell was ringing close to my feet&mdash;no person
being near me but Miss Fox, and she had both her
feet on one of mine, and both her hands on the table. This
is a faithful statement of facts, for the truth of which, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
far as they relate to the sitting on Friday evening, I refer
the reader to all the persons whose names are given above.
I refrain from conclusions and comments, and close with
the simple declaration that I am much puzzled and astonished.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">S. Albro.</span>&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>I may also be allowed to introduce a published letter of
my own, containing some important statements which have
never been contradicted. It was from no spirit of fairness
or liberality that the editor inserted this letter in his
columns. Mr. Rogers (the proprietor of the house) told
me that he had heard from him words for which he was
liable to a suit by me for slander, and that he would back
me in such a suit. All that was most honorable in Buffalo
also stood by me. I took my letter down to the editor
at the dinner table (he boarded at the hotel), and told
him he must publish it that afternoon, and also retract his
slanders, or I would have him forthwith arrested. This
was aloud, in presence of all the company at the table.
He submitted without resistance, and smoothed down the
slander by explaining it away, and by saying that he had
spoken only in jest. He published, and I was satisfied&mdash;as
were also all my friends.</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Buffalo</span>, March 14, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To the Editor of</span> <cite>The Commercial Advertiser</cite>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;I gladly avail myself of the privilege you have so
courteously extended to me to defend myself through your
columns against the aspersions which, if suffered to pass
unheeded, might bring temporary disgrace upon the cause
in which we are engaged as involuntary though willing instruments
of a higher power. Some time since, you gave
place in the columns of your paper to a statement, made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Professors Lee, Flint, and Coventry, which they put forth
to the public as an exposition of the &lsquo;Rochester Knockings.&rsquo;
The positions which they assumed we knew to be
fallacious and unsupportable, and we at once challenged a
fair and impartial investigation, believing that it was not
in the nature of these gentlemen to seek our conviction
of fraud contrary to evidence which I knew must convince
every candid mind. It is true that when our feet
were placed on cushions stuffed with shavings, and resting
on our heels, there were no sounds heard, and that sounds
were heard when our feet were resting on the floor; and
it is just as true that if our friendly Spirits retired when
they witnessed such harsh proceedings on the part of our
persecutors, it was not in our power to detain them. Dr.
Lee says he heard two sounds when he held Margaretta&rsquo;s
knees. I counted five at one time during that operation,
two at another, and three at another, which made ten instead
of two. But I do not consider this circumstance of
any importance whatever. The spirit in which they engaged
in the investigation was too palpable to be mistaken,
evincing too great a determination to carry their points to
admit of the possibility of a conviction. They had heard
sounds made by limber <em>joints</em>, and because one person
could produce one kind of sounds, made by knee-joints,
they would have the community believe that all the
sounds heard in our presence for the last four years were
produced by thumping or snapping the <em>knee-joints</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As professional men, whose reputation is dear to them,
I would like to have them tell your readers what condition
our poor joints would be in by this time, after three years&rsquo;
constant service in this almost ceaseless operation. I will
not call this quackery, but will be content to leave it to
the public to pass judgment on their professional erudition.
Two of the professors made little or no investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
They were in our room but a few minutes previous
to the appearance of the article in your paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Lee, however, was in to see us frequently,
and at several times expressed great surprise, affirming,
with great apparent candor, that the sounds were truly astonishing.
He witnessed the answers that were received
by Mr. Chase, which were all correct and very astonishing;
yet he did not attempt to account for them. Now,
if Dr. Lee can account for the correct answers that are
given, as well as how the sounds are produced, it will
gratify me very much, and I will try to account for some
of the large ones. Mr. Chase called again, a day or two
after that, and could get no correct answers; but this was
no matter of surprise to me after his having been in close
communion with <em>Dr. Lee</em>; for we are taught to believe
that Spirits associate by affinity, and if that be true, he was
no doubt led into a different society of Spirits by associating
with <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe the Spirits of my dear departed friends
could manifest themselves in their presence, and I would
not willingly call on them to mingle in such society. The
word &lsquo;Impostor&rsquo; grated very harshly on my ears, and I
struggle very hard to overcome the feelings which such a
cruel charge will naturally excite in every human bosom
where honor finds a lodgment; but, in spite of all my endeavors,
I still feel like other mortals; and this feeling
prompts me to demand justice at the hands of a discerning
public, and especially those who have witnessed the entire
success of the same experiments which proved a total failure
with our Esculapian knee-buckles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The committees, which have frequently met since the
affair with the M.D.&rsquo;s, have witnessed all the experiments
they attempted, and can testify to their entire success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, in presence of a number of persons, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cushions were brought out, and we took seats, elevated, with
our feet upon them, resting on our heels, when the sounds
were distinctly heard by all present. Captain Rounds and
Judge Burroughs were present on that occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our feet were held from the floor by Dr. Gray and Mr.
Clark, in presence of the whole committee, on the evening
of the investigation made by the medical gentlemen (after
they left); and the sounds were distinctly heard, which
was allowed by the committee to be a far more satisfactory
test, as they could distinctly hear the sounds under their
feet, and feel the floor <em>jar</em> while our feet were held nearly
or quite a foot from the floor. The whole committee consisted
of Dr. Gray and lady, Mr. Clark and lady, Mr.
Everet and lady, Mr. Stringham, Mr. Bristol, and two gentlemen
invited by the professors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of this committee were persons we had never before
seen, but we are informed they are persons whose
testimony can be relied upon. I would like to have Drs.
Lee, Flint, and Coventry club their professional lore and
perceptive acumen, and inform the public how bells are
rung, and gongs made to ring out tunes, untouched by
human hands; for, if you have any confidence in your own
citizens, they can tell you what I now affirm is true. I will
not be particular to mention the names of all the persons
who have witnessed these striking phenomena, but I will
refer you to the following: C.&nbsp;C. Bristol, Mr. Gibson,
Mr. Stringham, Mr. Stephen Dudley, Mr. L. Ramsey,
Mr. Pond, Mr. Gould, and Mr. Tallmadge; and they can
refer you to dozens of other respectable persons, who have
witnessed the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While these manifestations were going on, many of the
persons above-named have held us both so fast by the feet
that we could not stir without their knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They (the Doctors) have attempted to explain one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the least important points; and, as we know, have signally
failed. Now let them proceed to the more difficult points,
or manfully acknowledge their failure and our innocence
of fraud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Dr. Lee is the editor of the <cite>Medical Journal</cite> which
is published in this city, and as he saw fit to publish the
injurious report against our moral integrity, which was
made by the visiting committee of M.D.&rsquo;s., we hope he
will manifest the sense of honor which his standing in society
warrants us in looking for, by publishing the contradiction,
which must now be evident to him, and thereby
make the reparation as apparent as the injury. This would
be just, if not magnanimous.</p>

<p>To the above narrative of the Buffalo doctors&rsquo; affair I
append an editorial article from <cite>The Buffalo Daily Republic</cite>:</p>


<h3>&ldquo;THE PROFESSORS AND THE &lsquo;KNOCKINGS.&rsquo;</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was nearly three weeks ago that it was given
out in a very authoritative tone, and, if I am not very
much mistaken, the newly returned Minister from Bogota
was the oracular organ used on the occasion to proclaim to
the &lsquo;humbugged&rsquo; citizens of Buffalo, that in twenty-four
hours we should hear no more of the knockings. The
news flew about the city with the rapidity of lightning,
that the end of the &lsquo;rappings&rsquo; was nigh, that an awful
explosion was about to take place. A lady had been found
who produced noises with the knee-joints. The University
of Buffalo had examined the lady&rsquo;s knee-joints,
heard the noises, and pronounced them identical with the
sounds produced by the Rochester ladies, and, what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
still more awful and astounding, the University of Buffalo
were about to print their report in the Buffalo <cite>Commercial
Advertiser</cite>. Who could withstand such a shock?&mdash;It was
conceded on all hands that if the ladies could endure the
University and the <cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite>, they need
never fear any natural catastrophe. True to the prediction,
out came the &lsquo;report.&rsquo; Three wise men had spoken,
yea, three <em>professors</em>, professors even of Materia Medica,
Physiology, and of Principles and Practice of Medicine.
Be it remembered, too, that the University was under
the guidance of that good man, Millard Fillmore, as Chancellor,
and Dr. Thomas M. Foote, late Minister to Bogota,
as one of its council men&mdash;thus uniting to the collective
wisdom of the professors the great head of the nation, and
speaking through his immediate organ, the <cite>Commercial
Advertiser</cite>. Buffalo was the great battle-ground and the
University the great adversary chosen to annihilate this
already too wide-spread imposture. Now, do not understand
me as attributing any unkind motive to those gentlemen
professors; I have no doubt they were actuated by
a nice sense of duty which they owed to science and to
their fellow-beings to make the exposé. I could not say a
word against Dr. Lee or Dr. Coventry, if I wanted to; they
are strangers to most of our citizens, and only come among
us periodically, and I am informed that they are very
much respected so far as they have extended their acquaintance
here. Professor Flint has been a resident of this
city for many years, and is regarded by those that employ
him as an able practitioner of medicine. He conducts
the editorial management of the Buffalo <cite>Medical Journal</cite>,
in the last number of which he has devoted a large portion
of its columns to the matter of these &lsquo;mysterious manifestations.&rsquo;
I am only sorry that its circulation is so limited
as not to allow the investigating public to appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
its strictures. He intimates that the &lsquo;report&rsquo; was hastily
drawn up and contains errors, and in order to do the professors
justice, requests the press to recopy the article as
amended. There is certainly no impropriety in all that,
if the University left out some material argument, in their
hurry to explode a humbug of such vast magnitude. The
press can do no less than put them right. But is it a fair
mode of warfare? I am exceedingly ignorant of professional
etiquette in these matters, and as a friend of the
manifestations, I wish to ask the unprejudiced public if it
is right that the University, after having had their load and
fire, should insist that because the first charge did not
bring down the game, they should be allowed another shot
without some preliminary arrangements? The request
is modest enough, and perhaps, taken in connection with
the <em>fact</em> that the University got on to its knees before the
mediums, in order the more readily to detect the muscular
sensation of the knee-joints of the ladies, is a sufficient
offset to what might seem an unreasonable afterthought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The code of honor among gentlemen has settled the
question, I believe, that the first fire, whether mortal or
not, is sufficient evidence of courage, and that beyond that,
the question of honor is merged into a malignant desire to
kill. If the University is satisfied that they have exposed
the humbug, why ask to bring in new proof? Is it because
the ladies, instead of leaving town in twenty-four
hours, have staid as many days? Is it because the public
are more anxious than ever to see and learn more of these
mysterious manifestations? Is it because there is more
intense interest than ever elicited, the more the subject is
investigated? Is it because intelligent men are giving the
matter consideration? I ask, what causes so much disquietude
in the minds of the professors? Have they shot
off their gun too quick? Are they sensible that public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
opinion is not impressed with the belief in their assertions
and their exposé? Are they displeased because the ladies
keep staying in spite of their mandate to go home? The
University has taken up the cudgel to beat the hydra, and
as fast as one head falls a dozen new ones spring out (or
would if they could succeed in knocking one off). The
manifestations, instead of being content with mere knocking
on the floor, have commenced the ringing of bells
(some large enough to tire the arms of even professors),
pounding under the table, so as to leave visible manifestations,
sufficient to satisfy a dozen universities of its physical
ability, moving furniture, playing on musical instruments,
and various other demonstrations equally wonderful
and satisfactory to all who see them.&rdquo;</p>


<p>From one of Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s letters of this trying time,
I extract the following: &ldquo;Be faithful. Remember how
short the time of life is. Submit to every lawful investigation.
While you are being tested by the doctors, to
prove you make the sounds by snapping the knee-joints,
insist on having a committee of ladies appointed to hold
your feet, and for ever silence the blasting charge of toe
rapping, or it will cover you with a cloud of obloquy from
which you may not recover in years, if ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;W. Capron, who stood by us in our Rochester trials
and investigations, and who delivered the first lecture on
the subject of Modern Spiritualism, was, at this time,
editor of the Providence, R.&nbsp;I., <cite>Daily Mirror</cite>. From
him I also received the following note: &ldquo;I have not seen
the whole of the article referred to, but to me, knowing
what I do, the theories of knee-pan, or knee-joint, are
equally ridiculous. There never has been a time when
you could so completely kill all opposition as the present
opportunity offers, if you go through the fiery ordeal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
come out unscathed, <em>as I know you will</em>, for I know you
are true. You have stood fiery trials before, and have always
triumphed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After having met the several investigating committees,
and submitted to all the requirements of the public at
large, amidst a host of friends who came to the Phelps
House to bid us farewell, with many who accompanied us
to the departing train, we left them with mutual feelings
of regret, but amid their congratulations and prayers for
our future prosperity.</p>

<p>We had come to Buffalo for a visit of a fortnight. In a
financial point of view, we had never met with an equal success.
Not a few of the principal gentlemen of the city sent
us parting gifts of congratulation on a noble scale of munificence,
as tributes of sympathy for what we had had to
bear, and of gratitude for the demonstrative proofs of immortality
it had been ours to bring to their experimental
<em>knowledge</em>.</p>

<p>The day appointed for our departure our hotel apartments
proved insufficient to entertain our friendly visitors
who came to bid us adieu. The public parlors, being kindly
assigned to us for the purpose by the proprietor, were filled
to overflowing. Never can I forget that day, nor those dear
and noble friends.</p>

<p>And thus ended the short-lived apparent triumph of
&ldquo;the Buffalo Doctors.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">BUFFALO</span> (<i>Continued.</i>)</h2>

<p class="sbt2">Letters from John E. Robinson and Welcome Whittaker.</p>


<p>During the progress of all this, our Buffalo Campaign, it is
scarcely worth while to say that I received no end of letters
of sympathy and encouragement. The number must
have counted by thousands who had by this time witnessed
for themselves, not merely the comparatively small sounds
of the ordinary rapping near our persons, but sometimes
great knockings, as by powerful arms and heavy hammers,
on all parts of rooms and even outside of them; together
with ringing of bells, moving and lifting of tables, etc.;
to say nothing of the intelligent communications which
identified their Spirit friends, etc. All such persons
therefore knew that the Buffalo doctoral theory of <em>knee-joints</em>
was impossible and absurd, and felt no uneasiness
about the result of any real investigations. But many
of them naturally sympathized with us under the harassing
annoyance in which we were placed by the promulgation
of even such a ridiculous theory, under such high-sounding
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; authority.</p>

<p>From these letters I select the following.</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>


<p class="hd"><span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, February 26, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Leah</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;I received this evening your note (of rather diminutive
proportions), written day before yesterday. Having been
on the lookout for a letter for several days, it was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
acceptable. It is written in a hopeful and encouraging
vein, and, so far as what is expressed relates to myself, I
can take no exceptions to its language. I should think it
dictated in some intervening hour of quiet; one of the
few which pass above and tranquillize for the time the
unresting surface of your daily life. Such hours, let them
be passed when they may, come and go with all of us;
and the dial finger that marks their exit, registers also
the blessings which they leave upon the heart. Impulsive
as you are; accustomed as you are to excitement, and
possessing (as you do) a woman&rsquo;s fondness for the glare of
the world&rsquo;s gilded exterior; there is a part of your nature
better than the rest, which would often shut out from the
chamber of its occupancy those noisy and obtrusive influences
which corrode its brightness and rob it of its
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the part of your being (the Leah) whom I
would oftenest wish to have audience with; and in such
hours as I speak of I would consider it a luxury equal to
&lsquo;Wenham ice&rsquo; in the torrid zone, or a shower of vertical
sunbeams on an Arctic traveller&mdash;to <em>knock</em> at the door of
that inner chamber, and finding entrance, to sit down at
the table of your heart and commune with you face to
face. I have turned down the leaves in my memory whereon
the records of such brief communings have been made,
and it is no small pleasure to refer to them, as I often do,
during these days of denial. So seldom it is now-a-days
when the Spirit I would talk to answers my signal with the
words &lsquo;at home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (your friends here) want you <em>and the Spirits</em>&mdash;who
seem to think their bread-and-butter depends on their paying
court (in especial) to you and yours&mdash;to come to us
once in a while&mdash;like the chance sunlight that struggles
through the bars of the prisoner&rsquo;s window to reveal the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
gladness of the upper world&mdash;and rub the rust from our
chains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to come home next week, at any rate, even
if you are determined on going West again. And really, I
think you ought to visit Cleveland and Cincinnati before
long. You would find many good people in both places,
who would rejoice to see you and Margaretta, and who are
looking out for your advent there with no little anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bush read to me last evening a portion of a letter
from her brother, resident, I believe, in the latter city, in
which he urges her to come there and speaks of things connected
with Spiritualism somewhat in detail. I observe
Mr. Cogshall&rsquo;s book is noticed very fairly in the <cite>National
Era</cite> (of Washington, D.&nbsp;C.), a journal of high character
for literary attainments. I will copy the notice as follows:
&lsquo;We have read this book, and have been pleased with its
style, and impressed with the sincerity of its author. Still
we do not believe. Nothing short of sight and hearing
can convince us that the souls of the departed are really
rapping in such an audible and startling manner on the
wall which divides us from the Spiritual world&mdash;really
moving chairs and tables and ringing bells, and otherwise
disturbing domestic order and quiet. Yet, according to
this little history, some Spirits justify themselves for their
sudden incursions into our territory, by giving comfort to
the mourner and sweet assurances of a love which could
not die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all be an imposture, who can measure the depth of
that depravity which trifles thus with the holiest affections,
aspirations, and sorrows? Greeley in a late <cite>Tribune</cite> has a
rich joke. He says: &lsquo;Some brainless editor out in Milwaukee
not long since published the fact that he had an interview
with the Spirit of Captain West, of the steamer, who
reported that the noble steamer struck an iceberg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
went to the bottom of the ocean with all on board.&rsquo; Milwaukee
is a great place! Our George (Willets) thinks &lsquo;that
Spirit took some trouble to spread the news.&rsquo; It is presumable
that it was one of the Auburn Apostolic brethren.
What a pity that Spirits (some of them) are not less given
to lying. However, if they are capable of falsehood (as we
well know some of them are), it is better they should show
their hands, else their communications might work much
evil. The <em>good</em> shines out with a more glorious brightness
in contrast with the darkness of its opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough is known already to warrant the immense interest
which this subject is now creating, and I think that
there is in the future (not very distant) a glad day approaching.
I am sometimes disposed to be depressed. I
have very little from Spirits, such as I would most wish to
get communications from, and you can hardly realize the
sense of neglect&mdash;so to speak&mdash;which I feel. I hope, when
you return, some of my kindred Spirits&mdash;that delicate,
pure-souled sister of mine, in particular (a lock of whose
hair I took from among my papers yesterday and found it
as lustrous as when first taken from her perishing form),
may have some message to deliver to one whose love for
her is immortal. Leah, I want to whisper in your ear.
Turn from the table and the sceptics who sit by, and lend
me your ears. Last night, when my internal senses were
playing their pranks, I had a dream of you. You were at
your home, and my solicitude for the kingdom had led my
steps to the <em>capital</em> of the New Jerusalem. My best bow
had been made to the Spirits, the last words to you had
been said, and I was about going out of the gate, when I
remembered an important omission: and turning just as
you were closing the front door, I cried, &lsquo;Leah! Leah!&rsquo; and
awoke with your name on my lips; pronouncing it once
<em>audibly</em> after I awoke&mdash;just to see if you could come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
answer me. But no response came, not even an echo of
my voice from the walls of my room. Leah! Leah! I call
again, and will you come?</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2a">&ldquo;Yours in the bonds of patience,</span><br />

<h3>LETTER FROM WELCOME WHITTAKER.</h3>

<p class="hd"><span class="smcap">Troy</span>, N.&nbsp;Y., February 24, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive, by the Buffalo papers, that you have had the
unparalleled temerity to call public attention, in that place,
to the manifestations of Spiritualism; and that, too, without
so much as consulting for one moment the feelings,
prejudices, or <em>scientific accumulation</em> of certain of the
wonderful Faculty there. Well, they pounced upon you
as you might well suppose such (God forgive me!) <em>scientific
gentlemen</em> would, conscious as they doubtless are, that
their position on the pyramid of all human knowledge
is nothing short of the very cap-stone itself. Not only
have they, in most <em>chivalrous manner</em>, arrayed themselves
for your disrespect, but a masterly stroke, ingeniously given,
shielded the public forever against such <em>gross trickery and
imposition</em> by an exposé of the whole thing!</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! never three luckier D(og)s together than the three
M.D.&rsquo;s of Buffalo, who in so short a time lifted the veil
and exposed to open day the &lsquo;very mechanism&rsquo; by which
deluded thousands have been <em>led astray</em>, first by a course
of negative reasoning, the parallel of which, I venture to
say, cannot be found in all the annals of philosophic research.
This of itself must be sufficient to render the
names of Lee, Flint, and Coventry, at least <em>notorious</em>, if
not illustrious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, as if one death would not be a sufficient quietus,
they give the certain home-thrust (the mortal stab), in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<em>naked, positive proof</em>. Now was there ever anything equal
to that? When will such philanthropy, such critical discernment,
such zeal, and such science be appreciated? And
last, though not least, that highly respectable lady, &lsquo;who,
by a mental effort, can dislocate her knee-joints,&rsquo; and then
make the &lsquo;identical&rsquo; sounds so foolishly ascribed to the
Spirits, must not be lost sight of in the words of overwhelming
gratitude to these three M.D.&rsquo;s above mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, kind-hearted soul! she must possess an unbounded
share of the milk of human-kindness. No one can, for a
moment, suppose that she was solicited to expose her knees
to various <em>gentlemen</em> of the medical profession, for they
must be sufficiently acquainted with anatomy and physiology
to know all the <em>mechanism</em> at all competent to produce
those sounds. It must, therefore, have been on her part
perfectly voluntary&mdash;prompted purely by a most benevolent
desire to expose a <em>humbug</em>. But Spiritualism will
still progress, and its advocates shall gloriously ride over
all adversity, for God is omnipotent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If contemptible meanness, united with unmitigated
scoundrelism, can be found on this earth, it resides in the
black heart of him who coins epithets designed to rob defenceless
females of their spotless reputation, which is ever
of more value to them than life itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt, therefore, most indignant while reading the two
articles in the <cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite> of the 17th, and the
<cite>Courier</cite> of the 18th, both of which I believe to be palpably
libellous; and for which, I have no doubt, any able
lawyer would tell you a suit for slander would bear most
beautifully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought to advise you to proceed against these libellers
forthwith; but when indignation gave place to mingled
contempt and pity, I came to the conclusion that if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
could follow the example of Him whose persecutors were
the objects of his latest petition&mdash;&lsquo;Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do&rsquo;&mdash;it might perhaps be
best in the long run. But it is not always easy to determine
the exact point where forbearance ceases to be a
virtue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend from Syracuse told me the other day, that a
sum of money (he did not say how much) had been subscribed
for the purpose of having you visit that place. I
will meet you if I can.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2e">&ldquo;Yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Welcome Whittaker.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>LETTER FROM JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The City of the New Dispensation</span>,<br />
<span class="dt1">&ldquo;March 12, 1851, Anno Spirituum, 3.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Leah</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a woman you are! Why don&rsquo;t you write to
me? You know how anxious your friends are to hear
from you, and you promised to write often and to send
<em>papers</em> frequently. Only <em>one</em> paper have I received from
you. Everybody whom you care a fig for here in Rochester
asks me about Buffalo and <em>you, and you</em>. But I
am not <em>posted up</em> and cannot tell them of your triumphs
or escapes from the hands of the many-headed hydra
whom you have slain so often. Not having a line from
you a week ago, in answer to my last letter, I thought you
intended to return last Saturday, but no train of cars,
which I have heard of, brought you as a part of its living
freight, and <em>we</em> (that is I) are &lsquo;a-wearied&rsquo; because you
answer not our call to &lsquo;come.&rsquo; Now I <em>command</em> you, in
the name of all the gods of the heathen mythology, to
come to us, either <em>spiritwise</em> (on a sheet of paper of ample
dimensions), or <em>bodily</em> (as would most effectually comport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with our comfort and desire), by an early departing train
from our sister city, whose queenly dignity, in thus aspiring
to rob us of our Spiritual flame&mdash;the guide of our uncertain
steps&mdash;we are getting jealous of. I received a
good letter from your witch sister, my darling little Katie,
this morning. She writes with much cheerfulness. Says
she has commenced another quarter at her school (in New
York). She says also she is &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; to see me! You
know just about what is intended to be understood when
she thus addresses me (her friend and adviser); but Cathie
is fast learning to be a woman, and my prayer is that she
may escape the bitter trials through which you and your
mother have been called to pass. She adds: &lsquo;We had a
telegraphic despatch from Maggie, saying she would be
here last week Saturday; but she don&rsquo;t come, and we have
given up looking for her.&rsquo; She says: &lsquo;Give my love to
Leah and Margaretta, and tell them I want to see them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Willets and myself went over to see Clara
(your housekeeper) yesterday. She is getting along tolerably
well, but appears unwilling to remain much longer
alone. She is evidently afraid&mdash;thinks the Spirits annoy
her at nights. More than half of that is (of course) imagination.
Why not come home, and go again, <em>if you
must</em>, westward? But here I am asking you questions and
you do not answer them. Busied as you are, and tired as
you must be, most of the time, it is too much of a task for
you to write to me; and I don&rsquo;t know but George is right
in saying, &lsquo;Leah has found so many new loves that the
winds blowing eastward come not freighted with a thought
of <em>us</em>.&rsquo; Since the above was written an old friend from
the country has called in to see me, and one of his questions
was, &lsquo;Well, do your views remain the same in regard
to the rapping?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have had no occasion or
cause to change them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Doctor Flint&rsquo;s statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
has explained the whole thing,&rsquo; he said, and added, &lsquo;He
writes very plausibly and conclusively on the subject.&rsquo;
Now, this friend and relative of mine is a most excellent
man, and I thoroughly appreciate him as a good member
of society, an excellent husband and father, and an honest
man; but the light which illumes the pathway of his intellect
is not set on a very high hill! Leah, I ought not
to write to you, wouldn&rsquo;t if I could avoid it, and beg pardon
of propriety for thus making a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine to you&mdash;not forgetting Maggie and Calvin.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">EXTRACTS FROM D.&nbsp;M. DEWEY&rsquo;S HISTORY.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt2">Letters from Rev. Charles Hammond and John E. Robinson.</p>


<p>Before I proceed to our next field of operations, which
was Ohio, I may take the opportunity afforded by the interval
to extract from a volume entitled, &ldquo;D.&nbsp;M. Dewey&rsquo;s
History of the Strange Sounds or Rappings Heard in Rochester
and Western New York,&rdquo; two letters, by the Rev.
C.&nbsp;C. Hammond, and our good friend, John E. Robinson,
which will be found well worthy of perusal.</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM REV. CHARLES HAMMOND.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, February 22, 1850.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. D.&nbsp;M. Dewey</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;In compliance with your solicitation, I will
proceed to lay before you a brief statement of what has
fallen under my observation, in regard to the &lsquo;mysterious
sounds&rsquo; and &lsquo;demonstrations&rsquo; purporting to be made by
intelligent Spirits, who once inhabited an earthly tabernacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the early part of January last, in company with
other persons, I gained an introduction to the family in
this city in whose residence these sounds had been heard.
They received us politely, and seemed rather more cheerful
than what I had supposed would be natural for those
who were hourly exchanging communications with the
Spirits of the revered dead. A company of twenty or
more persons had assembled&mdash;the &lsquo;three sisters&rsquo; came into
the room&mdash;the sounds were heard&mdash;and through the medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of the alphabet, they, and about half of the company,
were directed to retire to another apartment. Our
company in the absence of the &lsquo;three sisters,&rsquo; whose
presence is generally deemed essential to these Spiritual
communications, were all seated closely around an ordinary
dining-table, when one of the ladies, bowing her head,
inquired, &lsquo;Will the Spirit answer questions now?&rsquo; No response
being made, I felt the disappointment of the lady,
and was half inclined to smile at the ludicrous scene,
when the searching glance of her suspicious eye falling
upon me, bade me maintain my usual gravity and respect
toward the company, and the occasion which had called us
there. After several ineffectual attempts to get responses
the sounds were heard, and the company generally were
privileged with answers to their respective interrogatories.
I availed myself of the opportunity, but gained no other
satisfaction than a prompt assurance that all my &lsquo;test
questions&rsquo; should be answered when I should come there
again. I went away sceptical, though unable to account
for the &lsquo;sounds,&rsquo; which caused the floor occasionally to vibrate
under my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my next visit I was much more successful. During
the interval I had prepared my mind with certain questions,
touching events unknown to the family, and of a remote
date. The sounds told me my age precisely, though
my appearance is such as to indicate a difference of eight
or ten years. The names of six of my nearest deceased
relations were given me. I then inquired, &lsquo;Will the Spirit,
who now makes these sounds, give me its name?&rsquo; Five
sounds directed me to the alphabet, which I repeated until
the name of &lsquo;Charles&rsquo; appeared, which answered to an
infant child whom we consigned to the grave in March,
1843. To my inquiries, it gave me a true answer in regard
to the time it had been in the Spirit-land, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the period since my eldest sister&rsquo;s death, which was nearly
eighteen years&mdash;the latter fact not being recollected then, I
found it true by dates on my return home. Many other test
questions were correctly answered; and yet, notwithstanding
that the origin of these sounds seemed inexplicable, I
was inclined to impute them to mesmerism or clairvoyance.
However, as the Spirit promised to satisfy me by other
demonstrations when I came again, I patiently awaited
the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the third visit, I was selected from a half-dozen
gentlemen, and directed by these sounds to retire to another
apartment, in company with the &lsquo;three sisters&rsquo; and their
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. A lighted
candle was placed on a large table, and we seated ourselves
around it. I occupied one side of the table, the
mother and youngest daughter the right, and two of the
sisters the left, leaving the opposite side of the table vacant.
On taking our positions the sounds were heard, and
continued to multiply, and became more violent, until
every part of the room trembled with their demonstrations.
They were unlike any I had heard before. Suddenly, as
we were all resting on the table, I felt the side next to me
move upward; I pressed upon it heavily, but soon it
passed out of the reach of us all&mdash;full six feet from me,
and at least four from the person nearest to it. I saw distinctly
its position&mdash;not a thread could have connected it
with any of the company without my notice, for I had
come to detect imposition, if it could be found. In this
position we were situated, when the question was asked,
&lsquo;Will the Spirit move the table back where it was before?&rsquo;
And back it came, as though it were carried on
the head of some one, who had not suited his position to
a perfect equipoise, the balance being sometimes in favor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a><br /><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of one side and then the other. But it regained its first
position. In the mean time the &lsquo;demonstrations&rsquo; became
louder and louder. The family commenced and sang the
&lsquo;Spirits&rsquo; Song,&rsquo; and several other pieces of sacred music,
during which accurate time was marked on the table, causing
it to vibrate; a transparent hand, resembling a shadow,
presented itself before my face; I felt fingers taking hold
of a lock of hair on the left side of my head, causing an
inclination of several inches; then a cold, death-like hand
was drawn designedly over my face; three gentle raps on
my left knee; my right limb forcibly pulled, against strong
resistance, under the table; a violent shaking, as though
two hands were applied to my shoulders; myself and chair
uplifted and moved back a few inches, and several slaps, as
with a hand, on the side of my head, which were repeated on
each one of the company, more rapidly than I could count.</p>

<div class="figcenter1"><a id="Ground_Floor_of_Troup_St._house."></a>
<img src="images/illus06.png" width="323" height="458" alt="Ground Floor of Troup St. house." title="" />
<span class="caption">Ground Floor of Troup St. house. But note that the rear room D is not on that level,
but in that of the Second Story: there being under it a corresponding dining-room: while
above A and C, and level with D, were bed rooms; and h is the Stair connecting the two
stories. A, Front Parlor. B, Hall. C, Bed-room. D, Sitting-Room (on floor above).

</div>

<p>&ldquo;During these manifestations, a piece of pasteboard,
nearly a foot square, was swung with such velocity before
us as to throw a strong current of air in our faces; a paper
curtain attached to one of the windows was rolled up and
unrolled twice; a lounge immediately behind me was
shaken violently; two small drawers in a bureau played
back and forth with inconceivable rapidity; a sound, resembling
a man sawing boards and planing them, was
heard under the table; a common spinning-wheel seemed
to be in motion, making a very natural buzz of the spindle;
a reel articulated each knot wound upon it; while the
sound of a rocking cradle indicated maternal care for the
infant&rsquo;s slumbers. These were among many demonstrations
which I witnessed that evening, amid which I felt a
perfect self-possession, and in no instance the slightest embarrassment,
except a momentary chill when the cold hand
was applied to my face, similar to a sensation I have realized
when touching a dead body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That any of the company could have performed these
things, under the circumstances in which we were situated,
would require a greater stretch of credulity on my part,
than it would to believe it was the work of Spirits. It
could not, by any possibility, have been done by any of
the party of individuals present, nor even attempted,
without detection. And I may add, that near the close of
the demonstrations at this visit, there was a vibration of
the floor, as though several tons in weight had been uplifted
and suddenly fallen again upon it. This caused
everything in the room to shake most violently for several
minutes, when the force was withdrawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have also tested the intelligence of these Spirits in
every way my ingenuity could invent. On one occasion,
I wrote a word on a slip of paper privately, placed it in my
wallet, went there, and the sounds, through the alphabet,
spelled that word correctly as I had written it. That word
was &lsquo;Sybil.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 20th of February, inst., the two youngest sisters
made my family a visit. Here the sounds were heard,
questions involving subjects wholly unknown to them
were answered, a large heavy dining-table was moved
several times; and on expressing thanks at the table to
the Giver of all good, some six or eight sounds responded
to every sentence I uttered, by making loud and distinct
sounds in various parts of the room.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;C. Hammond.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>LETTER OF JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">D.&nbsp;M. Dewey</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;As you have requested of me some recital of my
acquaintance with the phenomena known as the &lsquo;mysterious
knockings&rsquo; or &lsquo;rappings,&rsquo; as the popular term is, the
following is cheerfully placed at your disposal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My attention was first called to the subject, I think, by
Mr. Isaac Post, in the month of October, 1848, at which time
Mrs. Fish, with a younger sister, was living on Prospect
Street. I had previously heard accounts of something of
the kind which was said to have occurred at Hydesville,
Wayne County, of this State, the former place of residence
of Mr. John D. Fox and Mrs. Margaret Fox, now of Arcadia;
but had considered it, as most others did, the mere
offspring of excited imagination, or a trick made up perhaps
for the purpose of harmless deception. You may
well suppose that I sought an introduction to the singular
mystery with no very credulous ear. I could not doubt
the honesty of my friend Post, and from the reports which
he gave of his experience thus far, I thought the contrivance
must certainly be an ingenious one and well worth
one&rsquo;s while to unravel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went in company with my friend John Kedzie.
What transpired on the occasion of my first visit, I do not
distinctly recollect. My curiosity, however, was only increased,
and as an invitation was extended for further
observation, I soon became more conversant with the
mystery and those whom it seemed more particularly to
attend. I soon discovered that I must utterly doubt the
truthfulness of my senses&mdash;which, by the way, are not
deficient beyond those of others&mdash;or admit that there were
sounds produced in my presence, in some manner utterly
unaccountable. They were considered to be produced by
spiritual beings, but the bare fact that I heard noises and
could not account for them, was no evidence to me that
such was their origin. Some action of a (to me) hidden
law of nature upon inert matter might do this; or it
might, in some way, be the effect of animal magnetism.
I wanted to know if there was any intelligence connected
with, and controlling, these manifestations. That point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
reached, I desired to ascertain whether or not the signs of
such intelligence could be imparted to me in such a manner,
that I should know it was out of the power of these
individuals of flesh and blood to give them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had been informed that these manifestations, although
partaking of the same general features, did not claim to be
the production of any one particular Spirit or intelligence;
but that numberless Spirits, those most naturally drawn
by affinity to present themselves in the presence of visitors,
had and exercised this power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In accordance with the hint thus given, I asked the
noisy but unseen conversationist if I could have the privilege
of talking with my sister&mdash;then in the Spirit-world. An
affirmative answer being given, pretty soon a gentle rapping
was heard, and on my asking if this was the signification
of her presence, the reply was, yes. I then asked
a number of questions, referring to the time when we were
together in years long since past. The questions thus
asked were answered promptly and intelligibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afterward the same gentle rapping was heard in the
form of a call for the alphabet (five quick successive raps).
The letters were called, and a sentence spelled out (unsuggested
by any query), addressed to me and commencing,
&lsquo;Brother, do you remember,&rsquo; etc. I have not the memoranda
made at the time and cannot recall the precise language
of the communication; but the impression then made
upon my mind was that it was exceedingly like my sister.
They were <em>her thoughts</em>, clothed in the self-same drapery
which she was accustomed to throw around them. She mentioned
the disease of which her body died (consumption),
and alluded to the protracted cough accompanying it. I
asked if she was happy, and received an affirmative reply.
She told me, in reply to my queries, that human Spirits
after they leave this stage of existence enter upon a sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in advance of the one they pass from; that they are the
subjects of an universal law, that of progress, and occupy
such sphere as the state of their purity and advancement,
at the time of death (so-called), prepares them for, and
as various in its arrangements as are the classes of Spirits;
that the &lsquo;many mansions in the Father&rsquo;s house,&rsquo; are but
the varied spheres, suited to the wants and conditions of
their occupants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the occasions above alluded to, and many times
during the past year, I have had opportunities of this kind.
Very frequently when I have been at the house of Mrs.
Fish, the time and attention of these manifestations have
been engrossed by other visitors, and often, on such occasions,
I have been exceedingly interested. In a multitude
of instances I have seen individuals there, entire strangers
to the family, whose questions have been answered by
these invisible agencies with the utmost accuracy. I remember
at one time while there, a gentleman and his wife
called and begged an opportunity for a few moments.
They were non-residents of the city, and desired to leave
town on the morrow. The request was granted. We all
took seats around the table, and permission was given the
gentleman to ask questions. To the question &lsquo;How many
children have I had?&rsquo; the reply was, <em>one</em>. &lsquo;Is it living?&rsquo;
The question being reversed, the signal intimated to the
father (what was the case) that the child was in the Spirit-world.
He asked the child&rsquo;s age at the time of its death,
and the length of time that had elapsed since its death,
which queries were, as he said, correctly answered. He
then asked if the Spirit of that child would be allowed to
converse with him; an affirmative was given, and soon a
roll of light sounds announced the presence of the little
one. A signal for the alphabet was given, and the childlike
Spirit spelled out a communication to its earthly parent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the effect of which, upon the father, told but too plainly
the reality of the semblance. The mother then asked a
few questions, such as &lsquo;Are you very happy?&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you
often with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Must I cease to grieve that I have lost
you, and remember that you are permitted, although unseen,
to be with me still?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mother left the room in tears; but they were not
the outburst of sorrow. Gladness was in her heart (as she
said) for the first time since she laid her darling child&mdash;her
first-born&mdash;down to sleep on the bosom of its mother earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might give you a variety of instances to which I have
been a witness, wherein a remarkable perception has been
evinced by these agencies; but a statement of such things
goes but a little way toward convincing a sceptic, or satisfying
the mind of any one who has not the opportunity of
observing for himself. The human mind admits with extreme
reluctance the truth of things which it has been
trained to believe without the range of possibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thus given to you, as briefly as possible, what you
have asked me for. My convictions are the result of patient
and honest investigation, extending through a period
of sixteen months. They are fixed&mdash;so far as the prime
fact is concerned, that a communication exists between
the inhabitants of &lsquo;this breathing world,&rsquo; and a distinct
order of intelligences invisible to the outward eye. If at
any time I embrace an error, I would thank him who
should point it out and demonstrate the truth. But mere
argument, however ingenious, can never move my convictions
on this subject. I have submitted everything to the
scrutiny of such powers as God has given to the highest
nature I possess, and know no better guide to lead me; and
any evidence which shall change my opinions must reach
me through the same channels of the mind by which these
convictions entered it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would not be out of place, in this connection,
to state (what many are aware of) that the family to whom
I have alluded as the ones in whose presence these manifestations
occur&mdash;although by no means the only ones&mdash;have,
in consequence of the circumstances, been subject of
much misrepresentation, and, in some instances, of serious
wrong. This might have been expected at the hands of
those who are ever ready to cast opprobrium on individual
character if it chance to be allied in any way to what <em>to
them</em> is unaccountable, or cannot be made to serve their
peculiar views and purposes. During my acquaintance
with them I have never discovered the least ground for
the justice of such charges. I have known them intimately
nearly a year and a half, and some of my friends have been
acquainted with them for many years. No one has ever
suggested to me the belief that any of the family had been
guilty of any departure from moral rectitude. I have uniformly
been treated by them with courtesy and kindness;
and they have, on all proper occasions, extended to me such
facilities as were requisite to enable me to prosecute my
inquiries. They make no ultra pretensions to what the
world calls piety, neither do they claim exemption from the
venial faults which exist more or less in all their fellow-beings.
Neither do they set up the false claim (which
some exceedingly soft heads have imputed to them) that
they, as individuals, are inspired, or have a mission from
the Deity to this world. They are <em>merely</em> the <em>passive
media</em> through whom these communications are made to
us, from the world of Spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recognizing then, as I do&mdash;what to me is undeniable&mdash;that
for some wise purpose, intelligences in another sphere
of existence are permitted to communicate with us in this
way, numberless questions have suggested themselves to
my mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As nothing important ever takes place in the wide
realm of the Universe, <em>unconnected with a purpose</em>, what
is the aim of this?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I answer&mdash;as I did involuntarily, in the first stage of my
experience&mdash;to teach mankind that what they have been
harboring as a shadow, but never known, is in truth a
reality; that the interior man, the sentient being</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;That stirs within and animates the clay,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is immortal and never dies. This consideration, were there
no others, is quite sufficient. But it is not to be supposed
that we have yet been made acquainted with all the bearings
which it is to have upon us and our welfare. If these Spiritual
beings are indeed what they purport to be&mdash;human
Spirits&mdash;our own kith and kin, who once walked with us on
earth, and still sympathize with us; then, indeed, we may
be immensely benefited by what they may unfold to us.
That they <em>are such</em>, I have no positive knowledge or evidence,
and none sufficiently strong to warrant the assertion.
It is somewhat difficult to identify them, with our present
crude and limited knowledge. The best we can do, is to
judge for ourselves from the correspondences of things. If
I converse with a Spirit, and its language&mdash;as addressed to
me&mdash;corresponds closely with the mind of that individual,
as I knew it in this life&mdash;and particularly if it alluded to occurrences
known only <em>to myself and it</em>&mdash;I have an analogical
evidence of its identity. On the other hand, if such
Spirit gives me a communication, the sentiment and structure
of which are totally at variance with my perception
of the individual thus personated, I have the same kind of
evidence (but no other) that the said Spirit has sought to
deceive me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus you will perceive my impression to be that Spirits
of various grades of intelligence and moral dignity in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
scale of being, are allowed the same power; and those
persons who seek intercourse with <em>the good</em>, need all the
panoply of truth and sincerity to guard them from contact
with the opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This admission, however, is by no means condemnatory
of the whole matter. A Wisdom, exceeding man&rsquo;s, allows
good and evil men to live in this world; but it does not
follow that, because I may occasionally chance to meet with
one of the latter, I am to deny myself communication with
the former. We must do the best we can in our condition;
act, as well as we may, the part for which we are adapted
by the attributes with which Deity hath endowed us. And
if, in order to commune occasionally with a bright being
of the upper sphere, I am, at times, subjected to annoyance
by one of a lower order (a devil, if you please), I can well
afford it, and come off best in the <em>finale</em>. These unseen
devils, after all the disrespect that has been shown them,
if I have met them in council, have evinced the possession
of nothing <em>much</em> worse than ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here let me say, I am of the serious opinion that
<em>all</em> the devils of the universe are not <em>yet</em> congregated in the
Spirit-world. Many, alas! too many of them, are clothed
with human forms, and move in our midst, visible to the common
eye. They are spirits of darkness, with a moral depravity
which would do no discredit to any locality ever dreamed
of in a vision of hell itself. Their presence is confined to
no one particular class. They enter your Senate chamber
even, sometimes, and distract the councils of honest men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will it be, in that strange economy which our dark
vision seeks in vain to fathom, until man attains that
higher stature, that more perfect being to which we must
all hope he is ultimately destined.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE OHIO CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Return to Rochester&mdash;Attempted Burglary&mdash;Summons to Ohio&mdash;&ldquo;Rev.&rdquo;
C.&nbsp;C. Burr&mdash;&ldquo;Toe-ology&rdquo;&mdash;Gold Medals and Jewelled
Watch&mdash;First Public Speech&mdash;Committee Investigations
as usual&mdash;Calvin&rsquo;s Illness, and Henceforth Mrs.
Brown&mdash;First Spiritual Convention.</p>


<p>We reached our home in Rochester late in the evening,
and, as my housekeeper was absent, we were alone in the
Troup Street house that night. The friends had kindly
lighted and warmed the house, and were there to receive
us. After they left we immediately retired, and were
soon lost in sleep. I had not slept long, however, when I
was awakened by a voice saying urgently in my ear, &ldquo;Get
up and light your candle, quick!&rdquo; Supposing that Margaretta
had spoken to me, I replied, &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
but finding her fast asleep, I scratched a match, and had
just time to see the form of a man who had got the lower
sash raised and half his body into the room. He was, of
course, a burglar, and doubtless expected to find a booty
in the money which the papers had reported us to have
brought with us from Buffalo. My voice and the flash of
light made him start back so precipitately that he broke
the window-sash while making his exit. The visit was
never repeated. I may have mentioned that once before,
in my former house in Prospect Street, we had been awakened
by a voice bidding us to &ldquo;Get up, the house is on
fire.&rdquo; We found that the wood-box behind the stove in
the sitting-room was in flames, which would soon have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
been communicated to the door, within a few inches of
the staircase, which was our only means of egress and
safety.</p>

<p>On the morning after our return from Buffalo, to my
great surprise, mother drove up to the door, having just
arrived by the train from New York. Her first words
were, &ldquo;What is the matter? I have been so urgently directed
to come to you, that I feared something had happened,
or was going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She and Katie had remained in New York, during the
time of our stay in Buffalo, with the friends before named.
I may here mention that Katie attended school, all the
time she remained in New York, during the day hours,
and sometimes united in the séances held by the friends in
the evenings. Mr. Greeley often said, on the strength of
her childish letters, &ldquo;Katie, I expect to see you develop
into another Margaret Fuller some day, if you will only
give your attention to study.&rdquo; We employed private
teachers for the children, at the hours not compulsorily
absorbed by the public. I gladly stood the brunt of the
labors for their benefit in the matter of their education.
(See Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s letter of March 12, 1851, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_203">203</a>.)</p>

<p>After explanations, the upshot was that mother returned
the same evening to rejoin Katie in New York, taking
Margaretta with her. Soon after our return to Troup
Street it became necessary, to my great regret, to leave
the house, as the property had to be sold for division
among heirs; but I found a much larger and finer house
on the corner of Troup and Sophia Streets. The fatigues
of moving, following so soon upon the Buffalo inquisition,
brought on a serious illness, from which I had scarcely
recovered when I received such insisting summons, by letters
and telegrams, from good friends in Cleveland, Ohio,
that I was compelled to undertake the journey, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
proved to be the beginning of what was called &ldquo;the Ohio
campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So did events arrange themselves, or so did other influences
arrange them, to compel us to widen more and more
the fulfilment of the &ldquo;duty&rdquo; to &ldquo;go forth&rdquo; which had
been imposed upon us. Among the telegrams from Cleveland,
received when I was on a sick bed, was this one:
&ldquo;Mrs. Fish, we want you to come immediately to Cleveland.
It is vitally important.&rdquo; To which Mr. Post replied,
&ldquo;Mrs. Fish is not well, and we think it would be
dangerous for her to leave.&rdquo; Then came another, saying,
&ldquo;Burr is here, slandering you and all who believe in
Spiritualism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, my friends insisted on my waiting until I was
stronger, when a letter came containing a partial explanation
of the &ldquo;Rev.&rdquo; Burr&rsquo;s villanous conduct toward me.
He had slandered me so grossly that my friends would not
allow him to go unpunished. They had arrested him in
my name, and it was necessary for me to be there in person.
I also received the following letters from a valued
friend:</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland</span>, April 25, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>&mdash;There are <em>many</em> reasons why you should
visit our city. One is, we are anxious to witness the Spirit
manifestations, and another reason is, that the world-renowned
<em>cheat</em>, C. Chauncy Burr, will soon be here to expose
the Rochester rappings and the mediums. I wonder
if he will succeed as well as Flint, Lee, and Coventry did in
Buffalo! All this and more, makes it desirable that you
should come at once.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Very Respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;M.&nbsp;L. Wright.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland</span>, May 1, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>&mdash;Yours of the 28th inst. is at hand. We
are glad (as you see by the <cite>Plaindealer</cite> which we have to-day
sent you) that you have concluded to come. You have
many friends here who will make your visit pleasant, and not
disappoint your expectations. As regards Burr, his tongue
is no slander where he is known. We have decided the
Dunham House (for many reasons) is the best, as you
can have a first floor parlor with three rooms attached,
and the house is as respectable as any in the place, though
perhaps not quite as large as the Weddell. You will be
much better accommodated. The table is first-class. Telegraph
the day you will start so that we may know when
to expect you, as every one feels anxious to meet you.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;With kind regards, yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;M.&nbsp;L. Wright.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>All this decided my course and I went. And as my
mother and the two girls, Margaretta and Cathy, were in
New York, my married sister, Mrs. Smith, and her dear
little boy Charlie, and Calvin Brown, accompanied me.
Imagine our surprise when we arrived at Cleveland. A
party of our true friends escorted us from the boat to the
hotel, where they informed us they had arranged for a
drive to a water-cure resort some ten or twelve miles in
the country.</p>

<p>As soon as we had breakfasted and prepared ourselves,
we started on our excursion. There were several carriages,
and I think not more than two persons in the company
whom I had ever met before. Soon after our arrival,
the ladies took us into a beautiful grove and carefully explained
to me the nature of the slanders the Rev. C.&nbsp;C.
Burr had reported against me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>I think they were somewhat surprised at the indifference
I manifested. Atrocious as his slanders had been, I could
not work up my mind to deem them worthy of my stooping
to notice them. I said to them, &ldquo;If you ladies had
passed through one half the abuse I have, for the past
two years or more, you would not wonder that I am personally
quite indifferent to what all my enemies may say
against me.&rdquo; However, it was well that they had prosecuted
Burr, as they put him under heavy bonds, and compelled
him to keep the peace, and hold his slanderous
tongue.</p>

<p>Mother and the girls returned to Rochester about three
weeks after I left for Cleveland. The children, Maggie
and Cathy, were persuaded to go to Cincinnati with a lady
friend of ours from Rochester, Mrs. Kedzie, who had conceived
the idea of a western tour of mediumistic exhibitions,
and knowing that I was in Cleveland, they stopped
at our hotel to see us. Maggie could not be persuaded to
go further. Cathy, too, thought it would be much more
pleasant for her to remain with us at Cleveland, but inasmuch
as Mrs. K. had come with them, expecting to go on
to Cincinnati, I argued that having come with her, they
should fulfil their engagement. Finally it was decided
that sister Maria should accompany Cathy, with her little
boy and Mrs. K., to Cincinnati, and Maggie remain with
Calvin and myself.</p>

<p>I found out that the girls had left greatly against
mother&rsquo;s wishes, and I telegraphed her to come immediately
to Cleveland, which she did. Mrs. K. and my sisters
remained in Cincinnati about three weeks, and stopped at
Columbus, expecting to remain there some time; but when
they had been there about a week little Charley was taken
very ill. His life was despaired of for several days, during
which time all business was suspended, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Kedzie returned to Rochester. My sister Maria&rsquo;s husband
arrived about that time and found the child&mdash;as was
thought&mdash;hopelessly ill.</p>

<p>I was greatly distressed, and my friends gathered around
to condole with me. Every hour brought a despatch saying,
&ldquo;Charley still lives.&rdquo; I could do nothing but walk
the floor and cry in my despair. I had been the means of
bringing him from home, and I blamed myself, knowing
the effect it would have on my brother-in-law and sister,
if they should lose their only child, after having already
lost three dear little boys. In our private room we called
on the Spirits to advise us what to do. They directed us
to telegraph at once to Columbus to &ldquo;bring him here&rdquo; (to
Cleveland). We followed their directions. They started
immediately, and when they arrived the child seemed in
a dying condition.</p>

<p>I took him in charge, and <em>with the aid of Spirit advice</em>
soon found him convalescing. As soon as he was able
they returned home.</p>

<p>Floods of letters summoned us to all parts of the State.
I had even to hire other persons to help in the labor of
answering them. Nor shall I now undertake a narrative
of our tour. As a general rule, so far as it was possible,
we followed in the tracks of our arch-enemy, the &ldquo;Rev.
C. Chauncy Burr;&rdquo; and it was often announced that when
he should have concluded his course of lectures, the Fox
family would succeed him and afford the public the opportunity
of judging for themselves. As the Buffalo doctors
had gone in for their theory of knee-ology (with what success
the reader has seen), so the Burr theory may be called
that of <em>toe</em>-ology; for he had conceived the brilliant idea
of producing a sort of low raps, inside a <em>wide</em> boot, by
striking his great toe upon the sole, as any one may do
upon the table by pressing and over-lapping the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
finger by the index and suddenly releasing the latter. His
brother Heman was the one who thus operated, while he
himself figured as the lecturer. The head-waiter of the
hotel at which Burr stopped, told me how his toes were
inflamed and bloody from this exercise, and how many a
poultice he had had to supply him with. The difference
was always manifest between the mere underfoot uniform
sounds, yielded by this miserable trick, and the variety of
the &ldquo;knockings&rdquo; on tables, floors, doors, walls, and ceilings&mdash;now
faint, now approaching the thunderous&mdash;to say
nothing of the identification of the Spirits who were rapping
to us, through the recognized significance and truth of
their communications. Burr was at last almost hooted
and pelted out of the State; and at the court-house of
Painesville we were taken to see the marks of the showers
of shattered eggs and muddy pieces of turf which remained
to attest the reception he had received the day before.</p>

<p>Our progress was a course of triumph. I might fill a
page with the names of the friends in all quarters of the
State, including its best men and women, between whom
and myself arose friendships which time will never obliterate
from my heart. I will only name one who was to us
in Ohio what Greeley was in New York, John W. Gray,
the editor of <cite>The Plaindealer</cite>, and his wife, one of the
loveliest and best of women.</p>

<p>Out of the trunks and boxes of letters, whose contents
are beyond my power to explore, I have taken a few,
almost at random, with no time for selection, which are
given below, and from which the reader may gather some
particulars of this period, which will in part supply the
place of a narrative of our experiences in this, which I have
called our Ohio campaign. But I must mention the interesting
incidents of two gold medals having been presented,
the one to myself, in Cleveland, when I was about to leave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the other to Maggie, at Cincinnati. To Katie was presented
a beautiful jewelled watch and chain. I indulge
myself in the pleasure of showing mine to my readers. I
am unable to show Maggie&rsquo;s (which was oval) because it
has been unfortunately lost in a trunk that was stolen. I
say nothing of beautiful presents, in diamonds and other
jewelry, etc. from ladies and gentlemen, who often seemed
to feel that they could not do too much to show us their
gratitude for the certain and realized <em>knowledge</em>, received
through us, of the great truth that our loved and lost still
live and love us, and that &ldquo;death&rdquo; is only a brief separation
of those soon to be reunited forever.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Medal"></a>

<p>The following letters accompanied my medal and Katie&rsquo;s
watch and chain. The substantially similar one accompanying
Maggie&rsquo;s medal seems to have been lost.</p>

<p>I will mention one other incident in the course of our
Ohio experience, as being the first occasion on which I was
compelled, and mustered the courage, to address a short
speech to an audience. On an urgent invitation we went
to Painesville toward the last of May. We arrived there
late in the afternoon. We found many friends, in the
parlor of the hotel, awaiting our arrival and prepared to
escort us to the Court House, to see the condition in which
Rev. C.&nbsp;C. Burr had left it. Tufts of grass (it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
raining the previous night), bricks, broken eggs, sticks,
and tin pans, with which the reverend gentleman had been
saluted, were strewn all over the Court House. We advertised
through all the papers that, immediately after the
Burrs had lectured and entertained the public with their
toe-rapping expositions, the Fox family would be forthcoming
to give them every opportunity of testing the
truth of the real Spirit rappings. We were expected, and
everything was done to make our visit there agreeable.
The Court House was cleared of all the rubbish, and at
precisely eight o&rsquo;clock Calvin, Maggie, my sister Maria&rsquo;s
little boy, Charley Smith, and myself entered the Court
House with crowds of friends, amid shouts of &ldquo;Welcome
to the Fox family&rdquo; resounding from every part of the
room.</p>

<p>Lawyer Tiffany was there to address the audience, but
he was not able to make himself heard, but stood and
smiled at the demonstration. The audience, with one
accord, called out, &ldquo;Take the platform!&rdquo; Calvin accompanied
us, leaving little Charley with a lady friend, but he
was frightened and cried, &ldquo;Take me too.&rdquo; He was only
two and a half years old. Judge Bissell carried the child
in his arms, and placed him by my side. He looked up
at me and said, &ldquo;Aunt Leah, will they hurt you?&rdquo; I
told him, &ldquo;No, dear, they are our friends.&rdquo; The rappings
were distinctly heard all over the hall as soon as quiet was
restored. The audience would not be content until I
spoke to them. My words were few. I thanked them
for their kindness, but tears of gratitude soon choked all
further utterance. This was my first public speech.</p>

<p>At this point, Mr. Tiffany was allowed to proceed with
his lecture, which was very satisfactory to the audience.</p>

<p>We had engaged to go a second time to Cincinnati,
as there were many there who had not had an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of visiting Katy&rsquo;s rooms while she was there in company
with sister Maria and Mrs. Kedzie, about the 20th of
July.</p>

<p>The cholera had broken out in the Burnett House, and
we engaged rooms in the Walnut Street House, where we
remained during our stay in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>We were frequently invited to visit our friends living
in the vicinity of the city, and gladly accepted their kind
invitations, as it afforded us rest, change of scene and
atmosphere. We spent several days delightfully at the
house of Major Gano; and also made many visits at the
house of Mr. Longworth, the proprietor and owner of the
great wine vaults of Cincinnati, well known to the public,
and whose son-in-law, William Flagg, and his wife, were
interested in us. We submitted to the examination of
many committees in Cincinnati (and other places which we
visited in Ohio). We remained in that city until the
latter part of August. The weather was extremely warm,
and we were all prostrated with heat and fatigue, and we
longed to return to our home and friends in Rochester.
About this time Calvin was suddenly attacked with hemorrhage
of the lungs. Physicians pronounced his case hopeless.
Mother and I took care of him through that fearful
night. The following morning he said to us&mdash;taking each
one by the hand&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Mother and Leah, the only regret
I feel is in leaving you, subject as you are to the persecutions
of your enemies.&rdquo; Then fixing his eyes on me he
said, &ldquo;You have been a dear sister to me. The best
legacy I could leave you, as a protection when I am gone,
is my name. If we were married now, your widowhood
would be a great protection from the importunate intrusions
to which you are so frequently subjected.&rdquo; Mother
wept over him as none but a mother could weep. She
fully consented, and left us to decide as we both thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
best. We were married September 10, 1851, on what was
supposed to be the death-bed of our beloved Calvin, and
thus I became Mrs. Brown. Calvin recovered, however,
from that attack and lingered in tolerable comfort, until
about six months previous to his death, in May, 1853.</p>

<p>The agitation of the subject of Spiritualism resulting
from this our &ldquo;Ohio Campaign,&rdquo; of 1851, led to the first
Spiritualist convention in the world&rsquo;s history, so far as I
know, which was called for and assembled at Cleveland in
February, 1852, respecting which I find the following letter
from David A. Eddy, bearing date of the 28th of that
month:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enclose to you to-day a Cleveland <cite>Herald</cite> containing
a report of our convention, the first of the kind ever
known, and which may with propriety be called &lsquo;Spiritual
Convention No. One.&rsquo; It has had some effect in bringing
the subject before the people, and calling out investigation.
It has thrown the church into spasms. Everything in
Ohio is going on as well as we could wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Painesville, O.</span>, May 7, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>&mdash;Great excitement prevails in our quiet
little village at this time. Miss May Cronk has become
quite a satisfactory medium. Her development is extraordinary.
We think perhaps if you could spend about two
weeks or ten days with us, your presence would afford us
a fair opportunity to test the matter to our heart&rsquo;s content.
I see by the babble of the Cleveland papers that you are
expected in that city soon; some say that you are now there.
Burr is drivelling out his dolorous tale to large audiences in
Cleveland; but whether his cracking joints will endure the
torture much longer, has not yet been revealed. I hope
for your own happiness, as well as for the successful triumph
that awaits you, you may preserve your equanimity
and successfully resist all distracting influences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all anxious to see you here. Come.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2c">&ldquo;Truly yours,</span><br />

<p class="hd"><span class="smcap">Newark, O.</span>, May 19, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although a stranger to you, I take the liberty of addressing
you on the subject of Spirit manifestations; also
to give you a pressing invitation to visit our town in behalf
of a number of our citizens, as well as myself, who are as
firm as the rock of Gibraltar in the faith; although a great
many of us have not had the opportunity of witnessing the
phenomena; and the probability is that many of us will
not have the privilege of doing so unless some of our
friends, who are more favored than we are, will visit our
town and tarry with us a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not but be pleased, as Newark is one of
the most beautiful towns in the interior of the State; and
you will find the people very pleasant and intelligent, if
you can visit us. Please answer as soon as you receive
this.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2d">&ldquo;Yours with respect,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;E.&nbsp;S. Brownfield.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;P.&nbsp;S. I am here authorized to use the names of our
friends, some of whom you will doubtless recollect; also
others, for whose character and respectability I have but
to refer you to Dr. Bigelow, of Cleveland, who is well acquainted
with all, viz., Mrs. Boss, Mrs. Baker, Wm. Boss,
Thos. Holmes, Dr. Blair, John J. Mooney, Wm. Lyon,
Wm. Cunningham, and Lewis Evans, <em>who all join in</em> pressing
the invitation.&mdash;<i>E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;B.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHILLICOTHE COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Chillicothe, O.</span>, May 23, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will notice by the enclosed proceedings, that the
duty has devolved on us, in behalf of the citizens of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
place and vicinity, friendly to the investigation of the so-called
&ldquo;Spiritual rappings&rdquo; and &ldquo;manifestations,&rdquo; to extend
to you an invitation that we may be honored with
your company and have the benefit of your experience in
the investigation of that which is to us a subject of the
highest interest, and which we consider deserving the most
patient and devoted attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to the performance of our official duty as a
committee, we request you to accept from us, individually,
our warmest and most heartfelt congratulations, for the
dignity you have preserved, and the Christian forbearance
and charity you have manifested toward your opponents,
amid the many trying scenes you have encountered during
the last two years, while lending your aid to the investigation
of truths of a new and startling character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are the more desirous that you should honor us
with a visit, from having instituted some experiments ourselves,
with partial success, the particulars of which have
been published from time to time, to encourage the friends
of the science to pursue the investigation for themselves.
Circumstances, however, have not yet been sufficiently
favorable to its development to enable us to gratify the
public interest which it has naturally excited; and consequently
a visit from yourself at this particular juncture
would be particularly gratifying. We should be pleased
also to learn what mode of compensation would be the
most agreeable to you as a remuneration for your services.
Hoping to obtain from you a favorable reply, and a visit
at some early day most convenient to yourself, accept,
madam, our assurances of esteem and friendship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A meeting of the citizens of Chillicothe and vicinity,
friendly to the investigation of the phenomena known us
&lsquo;Spirit rappings,&rsquo; &lsquo;Spiritual manifestations,&rsquo; etc., which
have claimed a considerable share of public attention in
the United States during the last two years, was held in
the city of Chillicothe on May 23, 1851, at which Clement
Pine was appointed chairman, and George Armstrong
secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On motion it was resolved, That a committee of three
be appointed to forward an invitation to Mrs. Fish, of
Rochester, who, it is understood, is now in Cleveland,
to visit our city, that the citizens may have the benefit of
her presence and experience in witnessing the so-called
&lsquo;Spiritual manifestations.&rsquo; Johnson Lofland, H.&nbsp;M. Pinto,
and Jonathan Miesse, M.D., were appointed by the chair
said committee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved, that it shall be the duty of said committee,
on receiving an answer from Mrs. Fish, to call another
meeting, and make known her intentions in regard to the
acceptance or non-acceptance of such invitation, and in
case we should be favored with a visit from Mrs. Fish, to
propose such measures for her reception as may be deemed
necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resolved, that a copy of the proceedings of this meeting
be made by the secretary, and transmitted immediately,
together with a letter of invitation, to Mrs. Fish, by said
committee.</p>

and thereby give a few earnest inquirers after truth
an opportunity to satisfy their minds upon a very important
subject.</p>

<h3>CHARLES F. WHIPPO.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Castle</span>, Lawrence Co., Pa., June 9, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>: My object in writing this is to invite you,
in behalf of myself and many intelligent friends here, to
stop, on your way to Pittsburg, and spend a few days with
us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of your trials and troubles at Buffalo
and at Cleveland, and you have had my sympathy through
all. I hope and trust you will be able to stand up under
these persecutions, steadfastly and firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that truth is mighty and will ultimately
prevail. The Rev. Rascal C.&nbsp;C. Burr is on the wane, and
he will learn, before all is over, that &lsquo;honesty is the best
policy.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Very respectfully and truly yours,</span><br />

<h3>M.&nbsp;L. WRIGHT.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland</span>, August 23, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>: My dear friend, I promised to answer the
article by Green, through which you were called on to
enter the arena with Mr. Clark, for examination, etc. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
did so; but the Clark family came out boldly, and offered
to make oath that they knew nothing of the source of the
&lsquo;manifestations;&rsquo; that the article by Green was without
their knowledge and very much against their wishes. We
all thought best to suppress it for the present. You can
hardly imagine how much pleasure and happiness <em>we</em> have
realized when in your presence. That scene in the cemetery
can never die out from my memory. How can we
ever forget those sweet messages from our dear ones,
whose affection for us has outlived their mortality?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come with us again and permit us to listen to
those good old raps that first shook our scepticism and
brought us to a realization of the truth. That message in
the grave-yard, saying, &lsquo;My dear son, weep no more, the
fault was mine. No longer bow your head in vain regret
and grief. I <em>bless</em> you, be happy.&rsquo; Then the messages
from our dear children, bidding us to rejoice and weep no
more, &lsquo;We are all happy in heaven;&rsquo; and then, in answer
to my mental questions they spelled, &lsquo;We accompanied
you here&mdash;this is not our abiding place&mdash;we will return
with you and watch over you through the night, and communicate
with you at home.&rsquo; The promises have all been
fulfilled. We have the manifestations at our own house,
and the Spirit of our father is our guardian-angel now.
My wife holds daily converse with him, and he tells us
he &lsquo;is happy. All is well.&rsquo; This is not belief, it is knowledge.
Your friends in Cleveland are all armed and
equipped, ready to defend you now and forever. It is
midnight; my dear wife and children are sleeping quietly,
and those of the higher spheres are watching over them.
The midnight winds whistle fearfully around our dwelling,
and as I write old Lake Erie lashes her shores with a fury
perfectly terrific. May the good Spirits of the wave watch
over the mariner to-night and pilot him safely into harbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Our friend Gray has returned and wishes me to remember
him to you. Mr. Tiffany has also returned. You must
excuse him for not calling on you, as his child was very ill,
and passed away to its Spirit home last Wednesday. He
feels deeply interested in your welfare, and has attended
to all the preliminaries in the slander case, so that you
need give yourself no uneasiness in the matter. Judge
Bissell complains of your not writing. Be sure and write
to him immediately. He is your <em>true friend</em> and will see
that <em>justice</em> is done in your case. Judge Paine also, do
not forget to write to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Leah, <em>your true friends</em> (I need not name them)
are expecting you will locate here some day, not far distant.
We expect to see you in Rochester soon. My love
to your mother, sisters, and Calvin, with a great share for
yourself, and believe me</p>

<h3>D.&nbsp;A. EDDY.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland, O.</span>, October 28, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>&mdash;Your letter dated at Rochester, after
you had partially recovered from your severe illness, was
duly received, and I answered at length; but while waiting
to get hold of the precious bluff missive that appeared in <cite>The
True Democrat</cite>, to enclose to you, some time elapsed, and
when I finally got it, I found you were sojourning in Troy,
N.&nbsp;Y. So the letter was old, and I did not send it. I cannot
find words to express how glad I am to hear that you have
recovered and are able to visit a place where I know you
will have so many true friends; but we will not own to any
city that can produce more sincere friends than Cleveland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that Mrs. Eddy has informed you of Mr.
Crittenden&rsquo;s intention of making you a visit soon. Is it
not possible for you to come here again before close of
navigation? If not, you may look for me there the first
of January, or about that time. We want you to come to
Cleveland. We will select a house here where you will
be happy and comfortable. We pity those poor wretches
who are ready to persecute those who are too good to
breathe the air of the same neighborhood where they reside.
But never mind, you know and we know there is
truth in these new revelations, and the good work is destined
to lead men from darkness and doubt, into the blessed
light of truth and a hope which I despaired of ever obtaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your correspondence must necessarily be very large
and quite a task. The cause is gaining here daily, but we
want you here again. Adieu for the present.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;D.&nbsp;A. Eddy.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;P.&nbsp;S. We have all signed the bail bonds for costs in
your suit with C. Chauncy Burr. I presume Dr. Wright
has advised you ere this. Burr is much troubled, but do
not let anyone influence you to settle, on any conditions.</p>

<p class="sgn2">&ldquo;D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;E.&rdquo;<br /></p>


<hr class="l3" />

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM THE PRESS.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We learn by a telegraphic despatch from Cleveland,
that Mrs. Fish, the celebrated &lsquo;medium,&rsquo; will be here in
a few days, when she will give our citizens an opportunity
to hear the &lsquo;rappings&rsquo; to their entire satisfaction. It is
a singular fact, that notwithstanding the slanders heaped
upon this lady by those accomplished mountebanks, the
Burrs, she follows them up with a sharp stick, and meets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
them face to face. It is not very manly or very dignified
to slander a lady when she is not present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Burrs are still giving their exhibitions of toe-ology
to very small audiences in this city. Those who
have heretofore believed that the rappings were all humbug,
are now entirely convinced that they are not half so
great a humbug as these itinerant, catch-penny lecturers.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Pittsburg
Post.</cite></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<i>A Literary Man in &lsquo;Trouble.&rsquo;</i>&mdash;The Rev. C. Chauncy
Burr, the man who makes &lsquo;literature his profession,&rsquo;
has been prosecuted in Cleveland, O., for slander, by Mrs.
Fish (of the Fox family), who has laid her damages at
$10,000. He will now have the opportunity to prove his
charge, which he always contended could be easily proved.
It will be an exciting suit.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Providence Mirror.</cite></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<i>The Burr Burst.</i>&mdash;The Burrs have lowered their
colors, taken down all sail, and left Pittsburg, under a
good, stiff, spanking breeze. Mr. Courtney, O.&nbsp;S. Fowler
(the phrenologist), Miss Sarah W. Taylor, S. Parker, J.
P. Glass, Milo A. Townsend, Rev. Mr. Williams, Dr.
Ewing, and several of the most respectable citizens of
Pittsburg (so says <cite>The Post</cite>) are after them with three
columns of cards and sharp sticks, published in the Pittsburg
papers. &lsquo;What a terrible thing it is to be a terrible
critter,&rsquo; as Mrs. Partington would say.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Cincinnati Nonpareil.</cite></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;Mrs. Fish and her sister have returned from a short
excursion into the country, and will be found at &lsquo;The
Dunham,&rsquo; for a few days more. They have invitations
from almost every city in the Union to visit them, but
they are very contented in the Forest City.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Cleveland
Herald.</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<i>The Spirits.</i>&mdash;Miss Catharine Fox, the spirit medium,
accompanied by a married sister and a female friend, will
remain a few days at the Walnut Street House, where
they will be pleased to meet those who feel interested in
these manifestations, and who desire to investigate the
subject with candor. We were present last night, with a
number of friends, at an interview with the ladies, when
some of the manifestations were produced by the customary
rappings, which, to say the least, did not appear to be produced
by any physical effort of the medium. Miss Catharine
is a very interesting girl, and looks very far from being
capable of carrying out any humbug whatever. We can
do no less than request our readers to examine for themselves.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Cincinnati
Nonpareil.</cite></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<i>Personal.</i>&mdash;Miss Catharine Fox, one of the original
mediums of the Rochester rappings, has arrived in Cincinnati,
and is stopping at the Walnut Street House. The
public will have an opportunity for a few days to judge
for themselves in regard to things which have &lsquo;turned the
world upside down.&rsquo; As she professes to &lsquo;call Spirits
from the vasty deep,&rsquo; and Mr. Burr is here to knock them
in the head as fast as they come, exciting times may be
expected.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Cincinnati Nonpareil.</cite></p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Editor of the Plaindealer</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Cannot Mrs. Fish and the Misses Fox be prevailed
on to make us a visit? The fact is, Gray, we Michiganders
are wofully benighted upon Spiritual subjects. Everything
pertaining to &lsquo;the world, the flesh, and the devil&rsquo;
we understand perfectly; but when it comes to getting
communications from the other world direct, and seeing
with our eyes, we &lsquo;knock under.&rsquo; Our press, too, is anything
but free upon these subjects, giving only one side,
and concluding with the small bill of <cite>The Herald</cite>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
there are <em>no more</em> things in Heaven and earth than are
dreamed of in their philosophy.&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Detroit Correspondent.</cite></p>


<h3>FROM THE CINCINNATI NONPAREIL.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A Fair Challenge by Mrs. Fish.</i>&mdash;It appears that
the most sceptical in Cincinnati, even the editor of
<cite>The Daily Times</cite>, have to concede that toe and knee
joints have nothing to do with Spirit rappings. It has become
a settled fact that Burr&rsquo;s and the Buffalo doctors&rsquo;
theories are the silliest humbug theories of the day. But
the editor of <cite>The Times</cite>, in a spirit of malicious infidelity,
accuses Mrs. Fish and her young sisters, Margaretta and
Cathy, with having concealed about their persons some
sort of intelligent machinery, which makes the raps and
answers questions, whether mentally or orally put. The
editor deserves a leather medal for so sage a conclusion,
and should have one, had not the great demand for them
among Burr&rsquo;s followers and the Buffalo boobies exhausted
the stock of those ornaments and cleaned the market of
supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To silence this pretension, Mrs. Fish published the
following challenge in the Cincinnati papers:</p>


<h4>&ldquo;&lsquo;A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With my sisters, Margaretta and Cathy Fox, I will
remain at the Walnut Street House a few days, where we
shall be happy to wait upon all those who wish to satisfy
themselves as to the truth or falsity of Spirit rappings.
The editor of <cite>The Times</cite> generously acquits us of all joint
snapping, and I think we can very easily dispose of his explanation.
If there be even a shadow of suspicion still
lurking in any mind that the sounds are made by mechanical
contrivances of any character, we are willing at any
moment to meet a committee of ladies, to whom we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
give all fair opportunity of satisfaction. We only ask that
the committee shall consist of ladies whose testimony will
have weight with the public.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ann L. Fish.&rsquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>&ldquo;This same question was raised in New York when the
mediums were there, and by a coterie of ladies and gentlemen
of the very first families. One of the wealthiest
merchants went so far as to pledge a large sum of money,
that &lsquo;take the mediums unawares&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, not dressed for the
occasion), &lsquo;and they could not induce the raps.&rsquo; Others,
equally uncharitable and unbelieving, coincided with him,
and they demanded a committee of investigation forthwith.
They took the mediums into a room, bolted the door, and
erected a platform of tables, on which they were compelled
to stand. Here, piece by piece, they were disrobed by the
committee, and every article of wearing apparel examined
and laid aside. Not a rap had been heard during the
whole time, and the girls, to use their own language,
&lsquo;feared the Spirits, as well as their friends on earth, had
deserted them.&rsquo; After everything was completed and
order restored in the room, Mrs. Fish, in a trembling but
determined voice said, &lsquo;Spirits, if ever you manifest yourselves
to us again, do it now!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The raps came, instanter, like hail-stones, on every
part of the stage. The mediums were overcome with joy,
and every eye in the room glistened with tears of sympathy
for the sisters. There was, without, a large number
of gentlemen and others waiting to hear the report of the
committee; and when these facts were made known to
them by their wives and others on the committee, and in
tears, too, they with one accord repented of their unbelief
and cruelty. These facts were published by the said committee
in the New York papers, and created a profound
sensation. But it seems the Cincinnati editor has forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
this and a thousand other degrading tests, instituted
by a wilful ignorance, which these ladies have since submitted
to rather than lose what is of infinite value to them,
their own good name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will this valiant man dare accept this challenge from
a woman, and his wife be one of the committee to report
to him that &lsquo;he is a fool&rsquo;? We shall see.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="r2">Committees of citizens, from various places in Ohio,
were constantly coming to us; and every day brought requests
to visit them. But we could only attend to a few
of the larger places.</p>

<p>To show how widely Spiritualism has spread, and how
anxious people were to have the proof of it, I give a few
of the many letters of this kind we have preserved.</p>


<h3>COLUMBUS COMMITTEE.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Columbus, O.</span>, May 22, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Ann L. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>&mdash;The undersigned, residents of this city, in
common with many others of their fellow-citizens, feeling
a deep and abiding interest in the great subject of Spiritual
and immortal existence, anxiously desire to witness, and
investigate for themselves, the Spiritual manifestations

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland, O.</span>, August 27, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I snatch a moment in the hurry to say we are all well,
including the baby. She has got over her cough entirely,
and is more interesting, if possible, than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spiritual manifestations are gaining rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in Buffalo last week: saw Messrs. C.&nbsp;C. Bristol,
Dudley, Albro, and Hayes. They are all writing mediums,
and the things they write are truly astonishing.
Their hands are moved without any effort, and the evidence
of its being the work of Spirits is beyond the least flickering
of doubt. They all inquired (very interestedly) after
you, regretting they could not have seen you on your return.
Will you be likely to come this way again this fall?
We sincerely hope you will find it possible to do so. Do
drop us a line. How have you found things on arrival at
home? Mrs. E. joins me in love to you. We remain
truly your friends.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;D.&nbsp;A. Eddy.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>M.&nbsp;L. WRIGHT.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland</span>, September 8, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We received yours of the 11th, and were thankful for
it. You doubtless know what is going on here, as Mr.
Gray tells me he sends you the <cite>Plaindealer</cite>. Spirits
told us the truth about the Clark family, etc. You will
see my article signed &lsquo;A Friend of Truth,&rsquo; which heads
him off entirely and puts a stop to any further designs
against Spiritual matters. I have another article ready;
if necessary, I shall publish it. Burr is in hot water; one
of his attorneys called on me a few days since, and tried
to settle the matter and get it out of court, but your friends
here turn a deaf ear to all his propositions. He called on
me again yesterday, and asked me on what conditions I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
thought you would settle with him. (He not knowing
that you had nothing to do with the prosecution.) I told
him it could not be accomplished short of his acknowledging
in every paper of the Union that he was a liar, a
blackguard and a villain, paying the costs of the court, and
giving you money enough to purchase a place in this city;
and I did not know as <em>that</em> would do it. He is badly
frightened. Everything has been properly attended to,
and we have no fears of the result. Bail has been given
for costs and everything is right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear friend, do not allow anyone to influence
you to discontinue this suit. Burr deserves to be punished
to the fullest extent of the law, and for your own sake, for
the sake of your friends, and for the sake of the cause in
which we are engaged, permit it to go through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your visit here, though not a golden one, will, I doubt
not, be the most important event in your whole life. The
trial will not come off in the October term, but will quite
likely the next. We must all &lsquo;keep cool.&rsquo; Now, Leah,
make up your mind to settle in Cleveland, where you have
so many good friends, whom you know you can trust. We
intend to visit you before navigation closes, if possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember me to Calvin, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, your
mother, Maggie and Katie, dear little Charlie, and may
<em>good</em> Spirits aid you in every emergency, direct you aright
in all things, so that when called to exchange worlds, your
earth life shall close like flowers at setting sun. So may
we all live and die. My wife unites in love to you.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Ever yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;M.&nbsp;L. Wright.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>INTERESTING LETTER FROM MRS. AMY POST.</h3>

<p>The letter written by a venerable Quaker lady, who has
for years been a neighbor and intimate friend of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Fish and the Fox family, speaks a language so plain that
we have requested the privilege of publishing it, though
not so intended by the author.&mdash;<cite>Cleveland Plaindealer.</cite></p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, June, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend, A. Leah Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often thought of thee and thy company since
you left your beautiful home for an Ohio city, and have
been much delighted to hear you have found friends who
can appreciate the value and importance of this wonderful
development to mankind. When I think of the very
happy change it has made in my views and feelings, regarding
the present as well as the future life, I feel
anxious that all the world should become acquainted with
it. It is a wealth I had despaired of ever obtaining&mdash;to
be convinced that we have commenced to live a life which
will never end&mdash;a life whose joys, too, are enhanced by
our practices of goodness. I have always admired the
doctrine and wished to believe it, viz., &lsquo;Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
have,&rsquo; etc.; and also, &lsquo;In my father&rsquo;s house there are many
mansions;&rsquo; but the belief I had on this point was always
accompanied with a desire for more <em>positive proof</em> of immortality.
For some time before your family made me
acquainted with this blessed Spirit-rapping dispensation, I
had become more settled in the belief, and unreasonable
but popular doctrine of there being no half-way house;
but we must either go to Heaven or to Hell. But what am
I writing this to thee for? Thee knows how happy I have
been made, and how thankful I have been that you all have
been willing to bear persecutions and revilings, self-denial
and provocations, for the sake of the <em>Truth</em>, and clearing
yourselves from the imputations of deception. Oh! could
strangers only know as I have known the trials you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
endured and the sacrifices you made the first two years,
they could not be made to believe it an invention of your
own, nor pursued for mercenary purposes. Thy mother
has been so troubled and unhappy away from you all
that I could not feel surprised at her accepting thy very
kind invitation to come to you. The feelings of a mother
are tenderly alive to the interests of her children. I know
truly, therefore, I was very glad, for your as well as her
sake, to have your own mother with you, as you have never
before been without her guardian protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please give my loving regards to Margaretta and Calvin,
and do all the good you can. Believe me to be thy sincere
and affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;Amy Post.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>DOINGS AT THE DUNHAM&mdash;THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPIRITUALISM
AS RAPPED OUT BY DR. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the Cleveland Plaindealer.</i>)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So engrossed are we in worldly affairs, that we have
but little time to investigate Spiritual matters, although
opportunities present themselves twice a day at the Dunham
House. There are, however, a few gentlemen of
leisure who are taking up this subject systematically, and
looking into its mysteries earnestly. Some dozen of the
most intellectual minds in the city have formed a league
to jointly, candidly, and honestly investigate this phenomenon,
have already had two sittings, and report &lsquo;progress.&rsquo;
We have been kindly invited by this circle to attend whenever
our convenience would admit, knowing that we had
the moral courage to publish what we saw and heard,
without stopping to inquire whether anything similar had
been published fifty years before, or without consulting
the masculine grannies of the day, whether it met their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
approval or not. By such invitation we attended a little
while last evening, and found the company had progressed
so far as to discard all tests of the <em>medium</em>, of the <em>Spirituality</em>
of the <em>communications</em>, and were actually (as they
believed) taking lessons in philosophy from the ancient
masters. After sitting a while, and hearing a great variety
of rapping sounds, there was a loud knocker appeared
which was simultaneously recognized, by several who had
heard it before, as the signal of Benjamin Franklin. He
was a long time questioned concerning Spiritual matters,
sometimes answering by raps, and sometimes using the
alphabet. It was in substance as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirit is the great positive of all existence, and matter
the great negative. There is an elemental difference between
Matter and Spirit. Electricity and magnetism are
always connected with matter, and belong to it. The dividing
link between matter and mind is between magnetism
and vitality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are different degrees of refinement in the electrical
and magnetic media. Chemical affinities are electrical
and magnetic. Cohesion and gravitation also depend
on similar principles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time has not yet come when the true philosophy
may be explained, but will soon. Investigation and experience
will hasten it on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Repulsion in nature is caused by stronger attraction.
The ascension of a balloon from the earth is a fair illustration
of the principle of repulsion. Everything in the universe
takes its appropriate place by virtue of its elemental
affinities, and can occupy no other place, without changing
the relations of itself and every other body in existence.
The earth, as also every other heavenly body, is caused to
move in its appropriate orbit by the united action of every
other body in existence, and cannot be made to come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
contact with other bodies; for the combining influences of
all the separate bodies mark out separate paths for each.
Thought is mental motion, and is conveyed from one
mind to another through an intermediate medium, which
is put in motion by this mental action. This medium, in
its refinement lies between the nervous medium and Spirit,
and exists in every degree of refinement from the nervous
fluid to Spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clairvoyance consists in insulating the mind of the
subject, and in proportion as the mind is brought into
clear contact with higher refinements of this medium, will
the subject become clear-sighted. Biology, as used by
Burr and others, is an improper term. Psychology would
be a better word. The word Biology was used to make
the subject a humbug. The phenomena attending Psychological
(Biological) experiments, belong to the lower
class of mesmeric influences&mdash;and pass from them through
every degree, to perfect clear-sightedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much further information was given which we failed
to note. As the doctor promised to meet the circle again,
we hope to report a more complete theory. After which
the circle drew up close to the table, and various rapping
sounds were heard upon the chairs, the table, the floor,
etc. The sound of sawing boards, driving nails into a box
or something hollow, was repeated several times.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">NEW YORK CITY, FROM JANUARY, 1852.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Competing Claims upon Us&mdash;Decision in Favor of New York as
Residence&mdash;Death of Calvin R. Brown&mdash;Remains Removed
to Rochester for Burial&mdash;Personal Friendships&mdash;Alice
and Ph&oelig;be Cary&mdash;Course of Test Experiments at Dr.
Gray&rsquo;s&mdash;The Monday Evening Circle&mdash;Rules of Séances.</p>


<p>I have sketched our experiences thus far at Rochester,
Albany, Troy, New York, Buffalo, and Ohio generally;
after which I returned to Albany and Troy, a second time,
by the earnest entreaty of friends&mdash;taking Glens Falls on
the way, where I remained with my uncle John and Calvin;
my mother and the girls being at that time in Cincinnati
for the second time.</p>

<p>A fortnight after this I returned to my pleasant home
in Rochester (corner of Troup and Sophia Streets). I now
considered that we were fairly entitled to repose; and
thought that, after the publicity given to the Spirit manifestations,
through the press, and the thousands of our
visitors, including persons from all parts of the Union, the
<em>duty</em> imposed on us had been reasonably and, as I deemed,
sufficiently discharged.</p>

<p>But it soon became evident that isolation had now become
impossible. Invitations and appeals of the most
urgent character rained upon me from important individuals,
and from collective bodies of prominent men in the
respective cities and towns.</p>

<p>The Spirits, who had sent us forth, had well understood
that, after our hands had thus been &ldquo;put to the plough,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
it would be beyond our possibility to &ldquo;look back.&rdquo; Many
friends to the new cause urged their advice that we should
establish ourselves in one of the great centres of population
and movement, where the thousands and tens of thousands
of our locomotive people could conveniently come and
hear for themselves. New York was naturally indicated for
this purpose, but Cleveland and Cincinnati disputed her
claim; while our friends in Rochester insisted that their city
was the most appropriate and natural home and centre for
the &ldquo;Rochester Knockings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last our Ohio friends, and indeed all others, concurred
in the selection of New York, as a duty and for the good
of humanity; while still hoping for occasional excursions
for the benefit of other places.</p>

<p>At Rochester, by way of keeping up a continued hold
upon us, they offered to provide for the payment of the
rent of my house, in the hope that I would eventually return
to it. But this I could not accept.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget that day of our departure from
Rochester? Our friends crowded the depot, and the parting
embraces and hand-grasps continued even after the
train had started in its first slow movements. No small
number of our friends made their adieux in tears and blessings:
while, for my part, I remember that I did nothing
but cry all the way to Syracuse. This was in the early
days of January, 1852.</p>

<p>After a few days of stay with friends and relations&mdash;(for
we were an old Knickerbocker family, and it was in
my early childhood that grandfather had transplanted us to
Wayne County, which was to us then almost the far West,
with its deserted wigwams and wandering Indian hunters)&mdash;we
settled for a short time in a house temporarily taken,
till the one found for me by a good friend, Mr. Sweet,
should be ready. I established myself in West 26th Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
in a large and handsome brown stone front, in a neighborhood
then of first-rate excellence, in which I resided for two
years. From that house I removed to 15th Street, next
door to Irving Place; from which, after a residence of a
year, I removed, by advice of my friends, to No. 1 Ludlow
Place, which I left only to go to my husband&rsquo;s home in
West 37th Street, on my marriage, in 1858, which epoch
was also the close of my career of public mediumship.
Twenty-six years have now elapsed from that most blessed
of days to this. Our home has been indeed a happy one.
Though I have lost children, it has never been that which
Victor Hugo had not the heart to wish for his worst enemy,
a house without a child. Indeed, it has usually been full
of them. I am still &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; and my husband &ldquo;father,&rdquo;
to a well-beloved little crowd who are the same to us as
our very own, and by whom I am indiscriminately called
&ldquo;Aunt Leah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ma.&rdquo; And what with relatives, and
friends on visits, and nephews and nieces of whose education
we have taken charge, for the better advantages of
New York, it has been one pretty full of visible inmates,
as well as those who are not the less real because invisible.
And these latter are ever ready to respond, with the dear
familiar raps and alphabet, to our desire to communicate
with them; to say nothing of occasional manifestations in
other ways, of their presence with us. An earnest thought
or request rarely fails to bring our unseen ones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During two years from the date of my marriage with
Calvin R. Brown (see page <a href="#Page_230">230</a>), he had been slowly declining.
He breathed the last breath of his blameless life
on the 4th of May, 1853, while I was still residing in 26th
Street. He had attained the age of nearly twenty-nine
years. Professor S.&nbsp;B. Brittan preached the funeral sermon
in New York on the 6th day of May, at 8 o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
large concourse of personal friends and friends of the cause
of Spiritualism attended. After Professor Brittan had
concluded his discourse, Judge Edmonds delivered a short
eulogy which purported to come from the Spirit world. Dr.
Gray came in rather late, as he had been detained by professional
duties, and begged the indulgence of the audience,
as he felt it alike a pleasure and a duty he owed to the departed,
to pay a small tribute to his memory, and of condolence
to the bereft family. He then said, &ldquo;I have been
his attendant physician, and conversed with him daily during
his slow decline. He suffered much at times, but never
complained. He always met me with a smile. He had
no fear of death, still he wanted to live. He was firm,
truthful, and honorable in every sense. He was a husband,
a son, and a brother&mdash;and a linch-pin in the cause of Spiritualism.
Honor to whom honor is due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the delivery of the speeches, rappings were
heard all over the room, in response.</p>

<p>I regret that the paper, giving a minute account of the
funeral, has been lost. Arrangements were made by the
friends, Judge Edmonds, Dr. Gray, and Mr. Partridge, to
procure a church in Rochester, and announce through the
papers that the funeral would be held on the 8th of May.
These parties telegraphed a message to Isaac Post, of that
city, to the above effect, who immediately returned the
answer, &ldquo;Bring on your dead. My house is at your service.&rdquo;
We started on the following morning with his remains.
Our party consisted of mother, Maggie, Cathy,
Lizzie (my daughter), and myself. They engaged the
undertaker to go with us to attend to the burying of our
dead. We arrived in Rochester at seven o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span>, and
found the hearse and carriages at the depot waiting to take
us to Mr. Post&rsquo;s house, where already had assembled a large
company of friends who deeply sympathized with us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The funeral was appointed at ten o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">A.M.</span> of the 8th.
Rev. Chas. Hammond delivered the funeral sermon. The
remains were taken to Mount Hope Cemetery; from whence
we returned to Isaac Post&rsquo;s, where we tarried over night.
We engaged a travelling coach early the next morning, and
started for Newark, thirty miles east of Rochester. We
arrived at my brother David&rsquo;s about three o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span>
The children all met us at the turn of the lane: all were
delighted to see us. We took them in the carriage with
us; little Georgie, who was about seven years of age, was
wonderfully struck with the appearance of our deep mourning,
and said, &ldquo;Grandma, what makes you all dress so black?
Did anybody die?&rdquo; Mother replied, &ldquo;Yes, dear, your
uncle Calvin died.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Oh dear, that&rsquo;s too
bad.&rdquo; After dinner we all went to sister Maria&rsquo;s, a distance
of one mile, taking the children with us. When
David and his family went home, little Georgie wanted to
stay with us, which he did, and played with little Charlie
Smith until bed-time&mdash;when they retired and apparently
slept well all night. The next morning Georgie felt sick.
My brother Stephen harnessed up his horses, and we took
him home. They went for the doctor immediately, but he
died before twelve o&rsquo;clock that day. His funeral was on the
12th day of the month. Two Methodist ministers officiated.</p>

<p>It was a singular coincidence that two Universalist and
two Methodist ministers selected the same Bible text, the
same funeral hymns, and the same tunes, at the services in
New York, Rochester, and Newark. In my affliction I had
not noticed this until mother spoke of it, and said it was
evident that the same guardian influences had controlled
on all these three occasions, distinct as they were in time,
place, and circumstances. It was probably meant that we
should recognize and feel the presence of the unseen friends,
who thus signified their sympathy with us in our grief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizzie, Katie, and myself started for New York on the
morning of the 13th, leaving mother and Maggie with
David and Elizabeth, who had suffered such a sudden bereavement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I abstain from speaking of the private friendships which
grew out of so much opportunity for acquaintance and intercourse
with so many out of the best classes of New York
society (in the true sense of the word). I am proud as
well as happy to have enjoyed such high and precious and
ennobling friendships, many of which are not wholly
severed even by that death which only makes our friends
invisible for a time to our mortal eyes, since a thought, a
wish can still bring to me those signal sounds which are as
their voices. I will indulge myself here only with a page
or two about two semi-angelic women, Alice and Ph&oelig;be
Cary, who have now risen into the completeness of their
angelhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span> and <span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;be Cary</span> were among my truest, best,
and dearest friends. I was introduced to them by Mr.
Greeley when we first came to New York, and our friendship
continued during their life. We passed many pleasant
evenings with the sisters and a few select friends.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Ph&oelig;be, we met in Arnold&rsquo;s store,
the day before we sailed for Europe. She came and sat
down beside me, and laid her hand gently on mine before
I saw her. I was delighted to see her, but was startled by
her changed appearance. I rallied her a little, and tried
to cheer her. She smiled faintly, but not as she was wont
to do. Ph&oelig;be had made a confidante of me some time
before. She called on me late one afternoon, and sent
up word to me to come at once, as she could remain but a
short time.</p>

<p>It was an unexpected call, at that hour, and I hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to see her as soon as possible. She said, &ldquo;I could not
rest without seeing you. Sit down. I want to talk with
you.&rdquo; I inquired about Alice&rsquo;s health, as usual, and she
said, &ldquo;Alice will never be any better. What shall I do
when she leaves me? I cannot live without her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her dark expressive eyes spoke more than her words.
I tried to console her, but I did not know the nature of
the incurable disease that was slowly but surely wearing
Alice&rsquo;s life away. She remained some time, and when
leaving me at the door her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Cary (their father), and his elder daughter,
from Cincinnati, always visited us when they were in New
York, and they both related many interesting occurrences
which they had witnessed in their own family. I will
here relate their &ldquo;Ghost Story,&rdquo; as they told it to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had been a thunder-storm, and the pouring rain
had driven all into the house. Our new house was finished,
but we had not yet moved into it. This new house
stood opposite the old one. The rain was over, and the
sun was shining brightly when our mother called out, and
asked, &lsquo;How it came that Rhoda and Lucy were in the new
house?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The door of the new house was open, and there stood
Rhoda, in plain sight, holding Lucy in her arms. The
whole family came to the door, and all saw the same.
They called &lsquo;Rhoda!&rsquo; but received no answer. They
supposed Rhoda had gone with Lucy into the house to
escape the rain; when at this moment Rhoda came down-stairs
where she had left Lucy asleep. She, too, saw what
we had seen&mdash;the apparition of her own &lsquo;wraith&rsquo; with
that of Lucy in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All felt solemnly impressed, and believed it to be a
warning of something sorrowful. They went over immediately,
and examined every part of the house, but not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
trace of any human being was discernible. Rhoda died
within a year, and Lucy a month later. They frequently
saw Spirits distinctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(For further particulars of these events see a &ldquo;Memorial
of Alice and Ph&oelig;be Cary,&rdquo; by Mary Clemmer.)</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be possessed ready wit. She attended our first
reception (soon after my marriage to Mr. Underhill), after
we had moved into our new house. When she met me at
the parlor door, she whispered in my ear, &ldquo;My feet are
quite wet; I forgot my india rubbers.&rdquo; It had rained
hard that afternoon. I told her she could find a change
up-stairs in my room; and sent one of my girls to wait
upon her. When she came down into the parlor, she said
to me, aside, &ldquo;I little thought I should stand in your shoes
so soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These sisters were devoted Spiritualists, but knowing
how often I was importuned by believers and curious
people, they would sometimes specify, in their notes of
invitation, that they wanted me &ldquo;socially, not Spiritually.&rdquo;
I subjoin to this chapter facsimiles of two of Alice&rsquo;s precious
little missives, which I preserve among my treasures
of the heart. I add to them also facsimiles of the writing
of Horace Greeley and Judge Edmonds, which can never
lose their interest for Spiritualists. I leave Mr. Greeley&rsquo;s
letter as a puzzle to the reader to decipher it. It is well
known that a special apprenticeship had to be served in
the <cite>Tribune</cite> office to train a few compositors into the possibility
of reading his writing.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Greeley died in October, 1872, Mr. Greeley
in his great sorrow sought for consolation through the
Spirits. At his request Mr. Oliver Johnson came and
asked me to get a communication from Spirit friends of
Mr. Greeley. Mr. Underhill, his mother, Mr. Johnson,
and myself took seats at the table, and waited in silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for some Spirit to manifest. Very soon the alphabet was
signalled for, and this was spelled (it was taken down by
Mr. Underhill), &ldquo;Bear my message to my dear friend
Horace. Tell him many kindred Spirits are hovering
around him in this day of trial; and though he may not
be susceptible to our heart-whisperings now, when quiet
and rested he will feel the truthfulness of this message.
Truth will meet a response in his honest heart.<br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Alice Cary.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>COURSES OF TEST EXPERIMENTATION.</h3>

<p>One of the courses of test experimentation made within
this period in New York was as follows:</p>

<p>I met a party of gentlemen at the house of Dr. John F.
Gray, in Lafayette Place, New York City, for about two
years. The meetings were held once a week. The circle
was composed of Dr. John F. Gray, Hon. John W. Edmonds,
Dr. Robert T. Hallock, Dr. Hull, Charles Partridge,
and George Washington Rains. The latter gentleman
was an officer in the U.&nbsp;S. Army, and stationed at
that time on Governor&rsquo;s Island.</p>

<p>This party carefully, honestly, and scientifically investigated
the rappings and all phenomena connected therewith.
They sought to ascertain, if possible, the peculiar
temperament of both mind and body, or the predominant
qualities of either, or both, to become instrumental, or to
interpose an agency, between the visible and invisible
worlds.</p>

<p>They were disgusted with the silly pretended exposé of
the conceited &ldquo;Buffalo doctors,&rdquo; and the equally silly and
infamous C.&nbsp;C. Burr.</p>

<p>Major Rains was an educated chemist and fine electrician.
He arranged a swing, which was fastened to iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
or steel chains, sustained by tackles and pulleys attached
to the ceiling. I sat in the swing, and over my head was
a large glass of circular form, about two and a half feet in
diameter, and beneath my feet (which were about four
feet from the floor) was a steel circular disk about three
feet in diameter. The whole arrangement was suspended
by the tackles. Major Rains brought his electrometer,
and made every experiment that their ingenuity could invent
or suggest. They suspended the table; each person
in the room standing on horse-shoe magnets provided for
that occasion.</p>

<p>The physicians were provided with stethoscopes, and
placed them on different parts of my person. They all
declared &ldquo;that the sounds had nothing whatever to do
with the physical body;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;So far as we can discover,
the mediums have no more power over the sounds than
the investigators have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such has been the character of the verdict, whenever an
honest attempt has been made to discover the source of
the rappings.</p>


<h3>PRIVATE CIRCLE FOR MEETINGS ON MONDAY EVENINGS.</h3>

<p>This circle was composed of Professor Mapes, Dr. A.&nbsp;D.
Wilson, Dr. Kirby, Dr. John F. Gray, W.&nbsp;P. Sanger and
wife, Dr. Robert Hallock, George Willets, Hon. John W.
Edmonds, John T. Daley, and several others. This party
was known as Professor Mapes&rsquo;s party.</p>

<p>This party agreed to sit for development, and waive all
personal questions, as they wanted to learn all they could
of a general character.</p>

<p>It was also agreed, by the heads of the committee, that no
fanatic in Spiritualism, nor dictatorial or selfish individual,
should be admitted to their party. If, by chance, any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
conflicting with the harmony of the circle was admitted,
he was forthwith expelled. I could mention several who
were thus dismissed, or gotten rid of, after having been
admitted. I must pass over many very interesting and
important facts that were made known to and through that
intellectual and honorable party. One circumstance, as a
visible and tangible phenomenon, was beyond all cavil.</p>

<p>Professor Mapes was requested, by Spirit direction, to
place a number of three-cent pieces on the floor, under
the table between his feet, and they would let him see
what the Spirits would do with them. All the gentlemen
present searched their pockets, but could not find enough
to gratify the demand of the Spirits; so one of the gentlemen
of the party went out and succeeded in getting a
large handful of them. They were then more plentiful
in circulation than they are now. The professor then
placed them as directed. He scattered the coin on the
floor, and placed his feet in front of the money, protecting
it from any interference; they strictly prohibited all
women save myself and the wife of one of the company,
from the circle&mdash;for my sisters were at that time holding
sittings at their own home. The party was then directed
to examine the situation of the professor and the money.
The gas was burning brightly. I never turned down the
lights, and knew nothing of cabinets or curtains, and had
never, at that time, heard of them. The professor sat at
one end of the table, and I sat, facing him, at the other
end. We were at further distance apart than any other
two of the circle. The Spirits directed us to sing. We
sang a few minutes, and they spelled out &ldquo;look.&rdquo; The
professor moved back, and there, in five piles lying neatly
piled one upon the other, to the extent of four inches each
in height, were the three-cent pieces. The company were
all directed to leave their seats and look at them. Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Mapes made a draft of the positions of the money
before and after the experiment.</p>

<p>One of the party, a gentleman of veracity, had his gaiter
unbuttoned while sitting in the circle. He was greatly
excited, but, according to the rules under which he entered
the association, he did not speak until the manifestations
ceased. He was then called upon to explain to the circle;
which he did by holding up his feet and showing to the
circle that a playful Spirit had meddled with one of his
gaiters. (He wore cloth gaiters and low shoes.) And the
strangest part of the thing was that it could not be found
in the room. He was asked to explain what the sensation
was. He said, &ldquo;The hand that held my <em>foot</em> was icy cold,
and the nimble fingers that unbuttoned the gaiter were
burning hot.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;My gaiter was new, and buttoned
tightly.&rdquo; They were sometimes directed to get on
the table; and, without hands touching it, it would run all
over the floor&mdash;sometimes with one, and often with two
or three persons, upon it.</p>


<h3>RULES OF SÉANCES.</h3>

<p>At our public hours, none were admitted but investigators.
An intelligent waiter at the door received the
fee on their entrance, though the number was not inconsiderable
who were welcome without fee, nor of those to
whom, when I had reason to know them to be poor and
deserving, I afterward returned it.</p>

<p>The following were my private rules, made known to all
visitors, compliance with which was enforced by the general
public feeling, and by the respectful and polite tone
which characterized my receptions, and the personal consideration
of which all the family were the objects, from
our noble mother, who was usually present, to our youngest
sister, Katie (now Mrs. Jencken, in London).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center f9 r2">&ldquo;RULES OF ORDER.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each individual in the Circle is entitled to a just proportion
of the time, and that it may be secured to each in
turn, without interruption or annoyance, System and Order
are essential, to secure which, the following Rules of Order
are expected to be observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>First.</i>&mdash;Each person may use the time which properly
belongs to him as he sees fit, but, having so used it, cannot
again ask questions, or in any way appropriate the time,
except he is again reached in rotation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Second.</i>&mdash;Any aid that new investigators may require
will be cheerfully rendered by Mrs. Brown, but no other
person in the Circle should, by prompting, suggesting, loud
conversation, or otherwise, interfere with the person in
communication. <em>Particular attention is called to this
Rule, and an exact and rigid observance of it requested, as
its violation results in great loss of time and disturbs the
Harmony, which is essential to reliable communications.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Third.</i>&mdash;Conversation in the Circle, except by those in
communication with the Spirit, should be as little as possible,
and that aside and in an undertone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;All persons should follow, without delay or
discussion, all directions with reference to conduct, position,
etc., as compliance with directions generally insures satisfactory
manifestations, while neglect or refusal usually results
in their partial or complete cessation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;The ladies, in whose presence the manifestations
are made, will use their best exertions to satisfy all
inquiries; but since the manifestations, alike in their commencement,
character and duration, are <em>above their personal
control</em>, they cannot promise that all persons, or all inquiries,
will obtain answers, no manifestations being made except
as the Spirits will.</p>


<p class="center f9 r2">EXPLANATIONS.</p>

<p>The subject should be approached in good faith and with
entire truthfulness and honesty, by all who seek correct
responses. This remark is suggested by the law which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Spiritual intercourse is believed to be of universal application,
viz., &lsquo;<em>Like attracts Like.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The communications are mainly conversational in their
nature, and in answer to questions such as can be responded
to by the Spirits in the monosyllables, <em>Yes</em> and <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inquirers should direct their questions to the Spirits,
as if they were conversing with them in the body, stating
their questions plainly, either in writing or orally.</p>

<p>The answers by the Spirits are given by signals as follows:</p>

<p>Three raps signifying <em>Yes</em>.</p>

<p>One rap <span class="sp1">&ldquo;</span> <em>No</em>.</p>

<p>Two raps <span class="sp2">&ldquo;</span> <em>neither Yes nor No</em>, but variously,
according to the nature of the question, as: <em>not now,
not yet, not quite, don&rsquo;t know</em>, and the like.</p>

<p>Five raps signifying <em>Alphabet</em>&mdash;The Alphabet is never
responded to, except when the signal for it has been given
by the Spirit. Hence, to save time, it is never called, unless
the signal has been heard.</p>

<p>Continuous light raps indicate <em>an error</em> in the answer
just given. They annul the signal previously made, and
the question should be repeated.</p>

<p>Continuous loud raps indicate <em>want of Harmony</em> in the
Circle, and may generally be taken as a reproof in consequence
of some violation of the Rules of Order.</p>


<p class="center r2"><i>Admission One Dollar.</i></p>

<p>Hours: From 3 to 5 <span class="lower">P.M.</span>, and 8 to 10 in the evening;
except Wednesday and Saturday evenings, and Saturday
afternoons, which are reserved for private parties.</p>

<p>The mornings of each day are also appropriated to private
parties, the terms for which are five dollars for each hour,
and for which arrangements can be made by application to
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p><span class="acc">&#9758;</span>No visitors will be received on Sundays.</p>
<hr class="l6" />

</div>

<p>We received a great deal of money. There were occasional
days when my maid, the good and faithful Susie,
would make returns of a hundred dollars as the day&rsquo;s receipts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
but it was as freely spent as given. We, none of
us, have ever been accused of the spirit of hoarding; nor
had Mammon any temple in the home or in the hearts of
any of us, though Charity had; and that, I think, is one of
the frequent though not invariable fruits of Spiritualism and
intercourse with Spirits, observable in human character
and life. Money, and selfishness in all its forms, are apt
to shrink into small dimensions of value in the minds of
persons who communicate much with those of the next
life, and who thus come to know and realize, as a certainty,
the truth of <em>that next life</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">NEW YORK CITY (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Our Brilliant Success with the Superior Intellectual
Classes&mdash;Whiskey at Washington&mdash;Cognizance of Domestic
Secrets&mdash;Discomfiture of Anderson, &ldquo;the Wizard of the
North&rdquo;&mdash;Remarkable Experience with a Very Notorious
Person.</p>


<p>Our rooms were frequented by much of the best society
in New York; and it was common to see the street encumbered
with long files of carriages. Particularly the
intellectual and literary classes were familiar visitors, both
at our circles and in our private life. Many of them became
our most intimate friends. Hundreds of promiscuous
visitors were deeply interested, and were, in reality,
Spiritualists at heart who had not the courage to face the
social and business disadvantages attaching to the public
avowal of such a novel and unpopular doctrine, which the
clergy, as a rule, denounced. Several of the most highly
respected Senators in Congress having become open and
warm Spiritualists&mdash;among whom Gov. N.&nbsp;P. Tallmadge
was the most openly zealous&mdash;probably nearly all of that
body passed through the experience of our rooms; for I
frequently received telegrams from Washington for private
engagements for a party of a dozen or more. It was remarkable
how the superior classes of actors <em>took to Spiritualism</em>,
and I have been greatly interested in them from
my earliest acquaintance with them. My tenderest sympathies
have been awakened when sitting in circles with
many of them, who have been raised in my estimation far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
above the level of those who fancy themselves to be their
superiors.</p>

<p>This Spiritualism is a searcher of hearts, and the truly
good get satisfactory answers and elevated Spirits to guide
and watch over them. But to return to Washington, it
was not at that time a very satisfactory place for the prosecution
of Spiritualism: even though it was such a centre of
congregation from all parts of the country. It was, indeed,
a centre of political agitation, and business connected
with the Government; but at that time, at least, too much
whiskey was consumed there. The following letter from
my young sister Katie will sufficiently illustrate this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of my life. Only think of it! Last evening
a party of twelve fine-looking gentlemen visited our
rooms. All, but two, were as drunk as they could well be.
They made mean, low remarks. Only imagine Maggie
and me, and dear mother, before a crowd of drunken Senators!
One very fine-looking man stood up before the
crowd, and addressed them thus: &lsquo;I wish to be heard,
gentlemen. This is all a humbug, but it is worth a dollar
to sit in the sunlight of Miss Kate&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;(Margaretta had left in disgust.) At this sudden announcement,
all was still as death. My face was red as
fire. A friend walked up to me. He was from the Navy-yard,
and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him, he is drunk; I would
not pay the least attention to him. He is a gentleman
when sober; and when I repeat his language to him to-morrow,
he will feel ashamed of his conduct.&rsquo; We all
left the room, and that ended the scene. Oh, dear Leah, I
long to be laid in a peaceful grave. I care not how soon.
I would live on a crust of bread, and drink cold water, if I
could live a different life. Oh, how we wished for you,
dear Leah! I told them, if my sister Leah was with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
they would not dare insult us. They would be escorted by
officers from our rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Washington is a mean city. I despise nearly everything
I meet here. Gov. Tallmadge and Waddy Thompson
are honorable gentlemen. They bring their friends during
our private hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have written these extracts from my child-sister&rsquo;s
letter, to more fully illustrate the dreadful position we held
at that time. Still, some wondered how it was that the
&ldquo;Fox Family&rdquo; should have been the chosen ones, through
whom Spirits could communicate; and one little incident,
which I can never forget, transpired when we were at Barnum&rsquo;s
Hotel, corner of Maiden Lane and Broadway, 1850.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott, a tall, wiry, wriggling old consequence, walked
up to mother with his smirking smile (the rooms were
filled with investigators, and he wished to appear to great
advantage), and said, bending low, &ldquo;Mrs. Fox, can you
explain why your children should be mediums? Is it because
your family are better than other folk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother replied, &ldquo;Dr. Scott, can you explain to me why
fresh fish swim in salt water?&rdquo; They looked at each
other in silence, while the company roared with laughter.</p>

<p>Experience taught me to adopt a rule not to give private
séances to single strangers, but rather to only two or more
at a time. This was not so much as a safeguard against
personal impertinences (for such things were of rare occurrence,
and never repeated), but under the advice of my
Spirit friends, to afford some protection against malignant
enemies who might come (as had happened) under a mask
of friendly interest and honest investigation, and then,
when unchecked by the presence of another witness, give
calumnious accounts of their private séances. I might
cite some curious instances of this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>But I should have but few instances to tell of personal
impertinence ever having been addressed to me, though
thus living a life which constantly afforded to promiscuous
strangers the free admission to the presence of myself and
my young sisters, protected only by their dignity and their
noble mother&rsquo;s presence. I will mention but one, which occurred
in an Eastern city, in 1857, the hero of which was an
important man who had inherited from a far nobler father
one of the greatest names known to our history. The incident
occurred neither in New York nor in Washington,
but to name the city would go far to identify the person.
Five gentlemen were announced at one of my public
hours, of whom one was evidently the most prominent
man, and a sort of leader of the company. A glance sufficed
to show that he was considerably intoxicated, and that
some of his companions had had more or less share in the
conviviality which had preceded their visits to the &ldquo;Spirits&rdquo;
of a different kind. He is no longer in this life, but some
of the rest doubtless survive, and are not likely to have
forgotten the occasion when they had to retire ignominiously
from my rooms at a hotel.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Naturally during the years thus spent in the exercise of
my mediumship in New York, I became acquainted with
no small number of domestic and family affairs of the
most delicate&mdash;sometimes the most painful&mdash;character.
In the private séances so often solicited by visitors there
would arise, in their communication with Spirits, revelations
of secrets the existence of which was little suspected
by the outside world, and which, with me, were under no
less absolute and sacred a sanction of secresy than in the
Catholic confessional, or the confidential relations of the
medical man. And it is a happiness for me to know that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
apart from the communications received by visitors from
their Spirit friends, I have many a time and oft had the
opportunity of exerting useful influences on the minds of
some whose inmost hearts and lives have thus been laid
open before a sympathetic and sisterly eye.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>DISCOMFITURE OF ANDERSON, &ldquo;THE WIZARD OF THE NORTH.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I am tempted to relate one occurrence of this period,
though I do not remember its exact date. The newspapers
will supply it to anybody desirous of chronological accuracy
(it must have been about the middle of 1853). The
famous conjurer Anderson, &ldquo;The Wizard of the North,&rdquo;
was exhibiting in New York, I believe in the large building
called Tripler Hall, in the rear of a hotel on Broadway,
near Bond Street. He had advertised a challenge to any
&ldquo;poverty-stricken medium&rdquo; to come to his hall and attempt
to produce their &ldquo;knockings&rdquo; if they could, with
the offer of a thousand dollars if they should do so. Possibly
he had expected to crowd his hall for several evenings
by this clap-trap, as he was himself a conjuring trickster
by trade, he supposed that we were of the same
kidney, or class, and that we would not venture to accept
such a challenge from him. It happened that we (Katy
and I) arrived one evening at home from a week&rsquo;s absence
in Rochester, and were told at the door by Susie that
Judge Edmonds, Dr. Gray, and one or two friends more
were waiting in the parlor to see us. They had known of
our expected arrival at that hour.</p>

<p>Now, the object of our visit to Rochester had been this:
I had conveyed there for burial the body of a beloved
member of my family. After that interment, I was
further detained by the death of a nephew, and the same
undertaker remained to conduct this second ceremony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
The friends who were awaiting us at home hastily explained
the situation, Anderson&rsquo;s challenge, etc., and said that we
ought to be already at Tripler Hall, and urged our instant
starting. I pleaded the impossibility (physical and moral),
but they insisted that we must not leave that triumph to
our adversaries&mdash;for the sake of our cause as well as for
our own or that of our friends. They said that a cup of
tea could be prepared and swallowed in fifteen minutes,
and the upshot was that Judge Edmonds drafted a short
note to Mr. Anderson, which I copied and signed, announcing
our acceptance of his challenge and our speedy following
after our missive, with the sole variation from his
terms that the one thousand dollars were to go to some
public charity (I forget which), as we would not accept it.
A reliable messenger rushed off to place it in Anderson&rsquo;s
hands. We reached the hall with all possible speed and
found it crowded to its utmost capacity. I had the arm
of Judge Edmonds, and Kate that of Dr. Gray. We
arrived in time to hear Anderson reading aloud, at the
front of his stage, the concluding lines of the letter he had
received. He was in a perfect rage, gesticulating in the
most violent manner, denouncing the suddenness with
which this had been sprung upon him, etc., etc., and refusing
us admission to his stage. All know that conjurers
usually extend forward a long bridge from their stage over
the pit of the theatre, along which they travel to and fro
in the course of their dealings, and &ldquo;patter&rdquo; with the
audience. We and our respective escorts (we, of course,
in deepest of crapes, and dropping with fatigue<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the outer steps of this bridge, and moved forward toward
the stage, to which we came very near. But the violence
of speech and action by Anderson, who barred the way at
the other end, held us back. Mr. Partridge spoke from
the stage, and Judge Edmonds and Dr. Gray from their
places, relating the facts, how we had that moment returned
from burying our dead, exhausted with fatigue
and hunger, and heart-broken with grief, but had yielded
to their appeals to us to come instantly to meet the challenge
which had been addressed to us and to Spiritualism,
with the simple condition that the money staked by Anderson
should go not to us but to a public charity. It may
be imagined what effect all this produced upon the audience.
&ldquo;Fair play to the Rochester knockings!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair
play to the sisters!&rdquo; etc., etc., mingled with hisses, seemed
to come from every throat. A very little more, and I believe
the &ldquo;Wizard of the North&rdquo; would have been mobbed
on his own stage. But finding that we could not gain admission
to it while he thus barred the way, and it being
plain and patent to everybody that he had backed down,
and that we and Spiritualism were incontestably triumphant,
the crape-draped figures, with their highly honorable
escort, withdrew as they had come, and glad were we to get
back home and to disrobe ourselves of our travelling dresses.
The next day the papers told how Anderson had backed
down, and for a week following redoubled crowds flocked
to our receptions with their congratulations.</p>

<p>The conjurer might, of course, have been sued by us for
his $1,000, for the benefit of a charity; but we were satisfied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and cared no further for that or for him. He never renewed
the challenge, or if he ever did, in any distant place
when we were not there to respond (as is likely enough,
for such is a conjurer&rsquo;s trick), we never heard of it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Wizard&rdquo; had met with about as bad a fate as the
Buffalo doctors, with their knee theory, the Rev. C.&nbsp;C.
Burr, with his toe-ology, and the Harvard professors, with
their unknown theory&mdash;promised, but never put forth.
Anderson had, no doubt, never examined the numerous
&ldquo;investigations&rdquo; through which we had passed triumphant,
and had taken for granted that we were tricksters, like himself,
who needed our own stage, machinery, etc., and was
probably the most astonished of men and conjurers when
he received my unostentatious acceptance of his challenge,
followed up by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i> appearance of two black-draped
and travel-worn young ladies with their escorts, bearding
the lion in his den, and vainly applying for impromptu admission
to his own stage.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE WITH A ONCE VERY NOTORIOUS
PERSON.</h3>

<p>One afternoon in 1852, between five and eight (my private
hours), my good Susie announced a grand lady, apparently,
who had come in a fine carriage with a footman,
and who, when told that it was not one of my hours for
receiving, begged to see me for a moment. She was admitted,
in her satins and velvets, of good figure, handsome
and striking, though not beautiful nor longer very young;
lady-like in her deportment and general effect, though I
could discover that her language was not quite up to her
elegant style of dress and manner. She made on me the
impression of some woman of rather inferior antecedents,
who had been married by some rich man for her good looks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
She wanted simply to make an engagement for a private
hour, which I gave her for the next morning, and to which
she was duly punctual.</p>

<p>She had not been long seated at the table with me, after
asking some questions, when she bent her head down upon
the table and wept and sobbed convulsively, and called on
the Spirit of her mother, who, together with other affectionate
expressions, answered in substance, &ldquo;My dear child,
you were left destitute, and a helpless child, and neglected
and abused by those who should have taken care of you.&rdquo;
After recovering herself, she said, &ldquo;You little know how
this affects me. These are words of tenderness from my
mother; I do believe it, and I am sure of it. I was, indeed,
left a helpless child to the cold charity of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not remain very long, nor do I recall more details;
but she wept profusely and sobbed, and took my
hand, bidding me good-bye, leaving on the table the regular
fee of $5. I had no reason to expect to see her again,
nor any to doubt her entire respectability.</p>

<p>She soon after came again (my maid Susie announced
her as &ldquo;the rich lady&rdquo;) and engaged another hour for a
private party of her friends. There came with her, to
that appointment, three or four nice-looking and well-behaved
young women, and two little girls, sisters, of nine
and eleven years, whom she presented to me as &ldquo;my Gracie
and my Florence;&rdquo; and whom I, at the time, presumed to
be her children.</p>

<p>She asked, &ldquo;Is so and so present?&rdquo; (I do not recall the
name.) &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was answered; and she asked, &ldquo;What shall
I do with these dear children?&rdquo; The reply came, &ldquo;You
have done well by them so far.&rdquo; They were pretty and
sweet-mannered children, evidently under good training.
She said they were not her own, and that they were being
brought up at a superior seminary in Albany, and that on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
coming of age they would inherit a good property. She
turned to the children and said, &ldquo;Your father and mother
are here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! aunty (clinging to her), what do they
say?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say you must continue at school.&rdquo; (The
children loved her, and had wanted to come home to her.)
The Spirits then rapped out, &ldquo;We watch over you hourly.
When you pray we always listen to your prayers.&rdquo; There
was weeping and sobbing between the children and their
&ldquo;Aunty.&rdquo; Some questions then passed respecting their
property and minor matters. I afterward learned from
my good friend, Dr. Wilson, who knew all about them,
that the father, after the death of the mother, had fallen
into relations with my visitor (who, to me, was as yet
only &ldquo;the rich lady&rdquo;), and then, when he found his end approaching
(from consumption), had given her his directions
about his children, knowing her heart to be good,
and reliable for conformity to them. While this sitting
was going on an interruption occurred, which eventually
led up to such consequences that I must introduce it.</p>

<p>A French woman, an importer of laces and a pedler of
them, was announced by Susie, who knew that I had some
business with her about the purchase of some of her
goods, and I had to give her a few minutes. She was a
keen and artful woman, and having noticed the style of
the customary carriages at my door, she asked me if I
could not introduce her to some of my friends, to whom
she might sell some of her wares. I yielded to her request
(such women are sometimes irresistible), and the
result was that, on my showing my own lace to my elegant
visitors, they examined the store in her box, and two of
them engaged sets of lace from her. Through her acquaintance
thus formed with &ldquo;the rich lady,&rdquo; at whose house she
had to deliver her laces, she learned who she was, and it
was easy in New York then for such a woman to learn all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
about her. It will be seen below that the consequences
were serious for my poor visitor, &ldquo;the rich lady.&rdquo; This
French lace dealer had heard about the &ldquo;manifestations&rdquo;
at my house, and even knew something about such things
in France, and in her visits to that house, to me unknown,
as was equally the name of its mistress, she took on herself
the character of a clairvoyant medium, and played upon
them plenty of her cunning tricks, such as pretended entrancement,
etc., for which perhaps a door may have been
opened through the genuine experience they had had with
me.</p>

<p>My still anonymous friend, &ldquo;the rich lady,&rdquo; paid me
afterward another visit, in which she still kept me ignorant
of who she was. She came alone this time, and unbosomed
many of her sorrows to me. (How many others
have done so! some men, but chiefly women!) While she
was there in the parlor a gentleman came in (Dr. Schoonmaker,
a dentist, of 12th Street, a friend of mine, who I
believe is still living and remembers it) and was introduced
into the back room. By some accident of the opening of
the door, he caught a glimpse of my visitor in the front
room. He said to me, &ldquo;Mrs. Brown, are you aware who
that is in your front room?&rdquo; I said that we knew her as
&ldquo;the rich lady,&rdquo; though she was an uneducated one.
&ldquo;Have you never heard of the notorious&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; and
he told me her name, of which of course I had heard.
&ldquo;I am so sorry you have told me this,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;she has
engaged me for another day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am her
dentist; and she was in my chair a good part of yesterday.
Her fee is as good as anybody&rsquo;s; your advertisements
open the door to all investigators, and you have no right
to refuse her so long as she behaves herself.&rdquo; &ldquo;She has
certainly acted like a lady thus far with me,&rdquo; I could not
but answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Between then and her next engagement with me (which
was her fourth visit to my house), the lace woman had
played her fraudulent cards upon her. She had palmed
off upon her a fraudulent trance and Spiritualism, and had
prepared her for the coming of a handsome young French
officer, with et cetera, et cetera of a story. The upshot was
that this young man was the lace woman&rsquo;s son, and an adventurer
of whom the rich lady was made a prey. He pretended
honorable love and marriage, at which a sinful but
repentant soul clutched readily. She married him, and
paid me a farewell visit on her departure.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;You little know the good you have done to
me;&rdquo; and she threw on my neck a gold chain and handsome
cross. She kissed my hand and left it wet with tears.
&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I kiss your hand,
though I am much worse than you think me&mdash;or at least
have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My good friend, Professor Mapes, was present at this,
and public repute had made him know all about her.
After she had gone he said to me, &ldquo;You have done that
poor woman more good than all the preachers of New York
could ever have done. You have reformed one of the
vilest of women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I afterward heard that her handsome adventurer-husband
spent or got away from her all her money, and absconded,
abandoning her; and that she died destitute and
forlorn in a hospital in Paris. I could tell more tales than
this of women who have passed through my hands, or
rather those of the Spirits, between whom and them I
have humbly served as a medium.</p>

<p>I have thus far carried my narrative down to the time
at which my public mediumship closed with my marriage
in 1858. Of the five years spent in New York, I have
spoken only in the general manner of the present chapter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
though were I to enter upon the field of particulars I
should have to weary the reader&rsquo;s patience with a second
volume. I will only relate two episodes of that interesting
period: the phosphorus affair, and the affair of the Harvard
professors, for reasons which will be apparent. But
I must give them each a chapter to itself.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In this I but followed in the rut of custom. I do not now approve
of crapes and lugubrious mourning. Why thus parade insignia of
mourning for the mere disappearance of those whom we know to be now
more alive than when they were fettered by the bonds of sublunary life&mdash;far,
far happier and higher&mdash;and not less near and loving to us than
they had been when we could see, hear, and feel them with our natural
senses? Our immoderate grief only grieves them. Spiritualism will,
one day, put an end to the trade in crape, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; the scribe might well
add, &ldquo;the enormous exactions of the undertaker, which often impoverish
the living but sincere mourners.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">PHOSPHORUS.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Spirit Lights Visible at Dark Séances&mdash;Private Circle in Jersey
City in 1857&mdash;Solid Granules of Phosphorus Appearing
in Earth which I had Touched&mdash;Surprising and Distressing
Letter&mdash;The Good Spirits and Daniel Underhill to the
Rescue&mdash;Benjamin Franklin&mdash;Marriage to D. Underhill,
November 2, 1858, and Close of My Public Mediumship&mdash;Analogous
Phenomena in Private at Home.</p>


<p>I will here relate from my experiences a curious and, so
far as I know, novel chapter in the records of Modern
Spiritualism, namely, <em>the production of solid granulated
phosphorus by Spirits</em>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that that phenomenon actually occurred
through my mediumship, though under circumstances and
appearances highly suggestive (to our enemies) of trickery
on my part, and such as naturally to awaken uneasiness in
the minds of friends whom long experience with me should
have made, and had made, suspicion-proof in regard to me
and my Spirit guides; and that for nearly nine months I
was made very unhappy for the want of confirmatory evidence
as to the real objective genuineness of the phenomenon
sufficient to silence cavil and compel conviction. My
unhappiness proceeded from the consciousness that <em>some</em>
friends had doubted more or less (though never going the
length of signifying doubt to myself), while I could not
know <em>who</em>, nor how far doubt had taken distinct shape in
their minds. To a person of my temperament and temper,
however sustained by pride and conscious innocence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
I cannot easily conceive a more painful situation. But
thank God (and the good Spirits who have never failed
me in the long run), this invisible cloud which for months
chilled the atmosphere of my life, as a distressful something
keenly felt though not to be seen, cleared off like
the evaporation of dew from the surface of a mirror, as
will be seen below.</p>

<p>We never gave <em>public</em> séances in darkened rooms. I do
not approve of the practice. Many forms of manifestations
thus obtained are calculated to prejudice the investigator
and excite suspicion of the medium. I love to sit
with a few friends, who are prepared to witness manifestations,
whether in light or dark, and who have had sufficient
evidence to understand the conditions necessary to
enable Spirits to manifest themselves in form. On such
occasions there should not be more than six or seven persons
in the circle, and they should all be harmonious, and
sit together around a table; placing their hands in such a
manner that if any one shall stir, or change position, it
must be at once discovered.</p>

<p>When Spirits appear, they come surrounded with, or
luminous by, their own light. I seldom sat in a darkened
room without seeing lights, which were also visible to the
company.</p>

<p>I never used anything to conceal, or afford the Spirits
a hiding-place for anything. I was never directed to do
so. We (all persons present) have been told to sit in the
dark and rub the palms of our hands together; when, immediately
on that being done, sparks of light would appear.
(I can frequently produce such lights&mdash;or, rather, they
come of themselves&mdash;when entirely alone.) I suppose they
are electrical or phosphorescent; but there are different
lights. At times they vary in form, color, and intensity.
Sometimes they will be of the size of a spark; sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of that of a hand, or larger; sometimes flitting or flickering
about; sometimes&mdash;especially when a Spirit is communicating
with you by touches, or caresses, or otherwise&mdash;fixed
in front of your face, like a person looking into
your eyes; sometimes a vague, luminous cloudiness, suggestive
of a form or not, as the case may be. Mr. Robert
Dale Owen took every precaution to lock and seal the
doors; not that he doubted us, but because he was writing
a book for the sceptical world to read, and in his honesty
of purpose he determined to be &ldquo;sure.&rdquo; He was right.
His two books, the &ldquo;Footfalls&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo;
can never lose their interest and value to the student of
Spiritualism.</p>

<p>Frequently, while sitting with select friends in dark circles,
lights would appear in different parts of the room;
sometimes quite numerous. These sights were no new
thing to us, but very astonishing to those who had never
before witnessed such manifestations. In order to convince
such, the Spirits would direct them to examine the
room and everything in it; lock the doors, join hands
and quietly wait for manifestations. We were sometimes
directed to sing, but not to ask questions, nor to make any
exclamations of wonder, or expressions of opinion, until the
manifestations had ceased. Such directions must be complied
with, if we would win good success.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>I met a large private circle in Jersey City, for a long
time, once a week. Many of the members of this party
had met at my séances for years; but, as they could not
all come to New York, I went to their different houses
across the river to accommodate them. This party insisted
on sitting in darkened rooms. Some of them had witnessed
remarkable manifestations in our most private
séances. George Willets and wife were members of this
circle, and they desired to have others see a little of the
wonderful manifestations which they had so often witnessed.</p>

<p>I consented to do so, but the Spirits expressly directed
them not to attempt such an undertaking in a party so
little calculated to follow implicitly the directions requisite
to accomplish the results sought. We had learned, by repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
observations, that Spirits could, under certain conditions,
when we were all in bed and no person stirring in
the room to disturb the forces through which they operate,
disclose mysteries which hitherto were unknown in this
age of the world. After much persuasion, I decided to sit
for such manifestations.</p>

<p>The directions were given by the Spirits, and all were
anxious to see and know these facts through their own perceptions;
as it is difficult to &ldquo;realize&rdquo; some things on the
representations of others, however worthy of our confidence
and however possessing it.</p>

<p>Our first sitting proved satisfactory, so far as it went;
but the party were directed to be more quiet and not have
more persons present than could be accommodated conveniently.</p>

<p>The second attempt was at the house of Mr. Simeon S.
Post, and was successful until they became greatly excited,
and the directions were not followed; inasmuch as there
were too many persons present who were entirely ignorant
of the rules by which we were controlled; and although
they were permitted to make the closest scrutiny of the
whole previous arrangements, in order to keep the forces
undisturbed during their (the Spirits&rsquo;) operations, they
(the investigators) could not or would not, for want of
common sense, perhaps, follow all the directions.</p>

<p>This being the case, in order to gratify those who were
prepared and blest with good sense, a part of the company
were directed to go with me into the adjoining room (a
bath-room). While there the lights appeared, very bright&mdash;almost
blazing at times. I was faint and <em>my hands
seemed burning</em>. I naturally ran to the faucet to let the
cold water run on them, which greatly relieved the burning
sensation. But the floating, moving lights continued, and
being near the door, the lady of the house went out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the yard with me, where I instinctively plunged my hands
into the damp earth (it had been raining).</p>

<p>The next evening Mrs. Post <em>saw lights where my hands
had been</em>, and found in the ground several particles of solid
phosphorus, being guided to the spot by seeing the phosphoric
smoke rising through the ground, as well as by the
luminosity of the spot. They (my friends) could not comprehend
this mystery. They talked over the matter between
themselves, and my friend Mr. Willets wrote me a
letter, which I will here give.</p>

<div class="pl">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="sign">
<tr><td class="center">&ldquo;No. 6, <span class="smcap">Pavonia Place,</span></td><td align="right" rowspan="2"><span class="f20">}</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="smcap">Jersey City</span>, November 24, 1857.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Brown</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The members of the circle are expecting me to see you
and have a talk with you respecting the manifestations of
lights at Mr. Simeon Post&rsquo;s house last week. I argued
that the Spirits could produce phosphorus (in my opinion,
accumulated from the atmosphere and medium forces of
the circle combined). Mr. Post had not the least suspicion
of anything wrong, but could not account for the lights
appearing where your hands had been. I have stood by
you always, and in this case have done so, saying that I
know that you would not deceive any one. <em>Can you</em> explain
this matter so that it will be satisfactory to the circle?
You will not think hard of me for bringing this to your
notice, and believe me to be your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;George Willets.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>This letter of course implied that I might have had&mdash;what
had of course no foundation in fact&mdash;phosphorus on
my fingers. Nor could I have much blamed any in whose
mind such a thought might have arisen, however painful
to me, or however unjust the suspicion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Underhill had accompanied me to Jersey City. He
was a friend of Mr. Post&rsquo;s, who had invited him to join
the circle. It was convenient for him to call for me, as it
was on his way. I did not know that any one doubted
the genuineness of the manifestations at Mr. Post&rsquo;s, and
judge of my painful astonishment when I read Mr. Willet&rsquo;s
letter. I knew I was innocent, but did not know that I
could so prove myself. I prayed to the Most High to relieve
me from this terrible imputation. Mr. Underhill
felt sure of my innocence. In his own purity of heart he
could not doubt me. His sister had become a medium,
and spoke in unknown tongues. And his mother could
move tables by placing her hands upon them. She is still
with us, in full possession of her faculties.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;None know her, but to love her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None name her, but to praise.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Underhill came to my rescue in that dark hour of
my life, when old and trusted friends wavered in opinion.</p>

<p>If this volume were to be limited in its circulation to
New York City, where Mr. Underhill is conspicuously,
while modestly, known in the business world through a
long series of years, as President of one of its oldest and
most solid Fire Insurance companies, it would not be
necessary to say a word about his character for honor and
veracity. It best becomes me to abstain from doing so,
leaving to strangers to him to satisfy themselves by easy
inquiries.</p>

<p>He accompanied me to Jersey City, and how many
others (if any) shared his generous confidence I could not
know, as none had the rudeness or unkindness to manifest
their doubts to me. His faith in my integrity strengthened
and enabled me to stand the ordeal. I leave it to him to
relate the rest of the story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>


<h3>STATEMENT OF DANIEL UNDERHILL.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;On Sunday evening, at Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s, soon after the
receipt of Mr. George Willets&rsquo; letter, there were present
Dr. Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Johnson, Mr. and Mrs.
Cleveland, Mrs. Brown, and myself. Some of her most
intimate friends frequently dropped in on Sunday evenings
to enjoy a social cup of tea, and an hour or so in pleasant
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this occasion it was announced by the &lsquo;invisibles&rsquo;
that on Tuesday evening next an investigating séance, for
phosphorescent phenomena, should be held; and the following
persons were chosen by the Spirits to attend,
namely, Dr. A.&nbsp;D. Wilson, Henry Sheldon, Oliver Johnson,
Mrs. Johnson, J.&nbsp;F. Cleveland, Mrs. Cleveland, Julian
G. Davies, Mr. Downer, Mr. Beadle, Leah (Mrs.) Brown,
Katie Fox, Daniel Underhill, Dr. Kirby, &lsquo;if he wishes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parties not present at the time were notified and
invited to attend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon was requested to procure some earth,
which he did from under Brooklyn Heights, and brought
it with him in a cigar-box wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the parties were seated at the table, in general
conversation, directions were given by the Spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon was requested to unwrap the box of fresh
Brooklyn earth and place it on the centre of the table, and
darken the room. The box was placed as directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the room was darkened, the box was moved by
the &lsquo;Spirits&rsquo; nearer to Mrs. B., who then placed her fingers
in the earth. Her fingers soon became luminous, so
that her hands were visible to the whole circle. When
she removed her hands the light was turned on. Dr. Wilson
took the box, and with his knife dug out a quantity of
granulated phosphorus. In doing so, some of the granules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had not sufficiently hardened, and separated on the table.
The doctor, in endeavoring to pick them up, burnt his fingers
quite badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again, July 31, 1858:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this evening I called on Mrs. Brown (at No. 1
Ludlow Place), who stated to me that she had all day been
impressed that if she should have a sitting with a few
friends that evening, she would have manifestations of a
character to explain the mystery of the occurrence at Mr.
S.&nbsp;S. Post&rsquo;s, Jersey City (where I had attended a private
séance with her between seven and eight months previously).</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this occasion there were present Mr. and Mrs. Oliver
Johnson, Miss Knight, Mr. Kedzie (of Rochester), Mrs.
Brown, and myself. We retired to the back parlor, closing
the doors and windows in order to make the room quite
dark. Mr. Kedzie procured a bowl of earth and water, as
directed (by the Spirits), and placed it on the table around
which we were seated. While we were engaged in general
conversation and singing, lights were seen floating about
the room, at times immediately over the centre of the circle.
Mrs. Brown placed her fingers in the bowl, from
which arose a light, or vapor, which so illuminated the room
as to make her hands visible to all around the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bright phosphoric lights were also seen in the earth.
On examination, we found deposited several granules of
pure phosphorus, which we collected and preserved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the following evening Mrs. B. informed me that
she wanted to go to Jersey City, to the house of Mr. Post;
that if she did so, the same manifestations would occur in
the presence of his family; and she desired me, if I saw
Mr. Post, to inform him of her wish to do so, in order to
satisfy them that what had occurred there, in the commencement
of the dark sittings, nearly eight months previously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
was entirely beyond any control or agency of
hers; but she desired that no one should be present except
Mr. Post&rsquo;s immediate family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday morning following (August 4th) Mr.
Post called at my office. When I informed him of Mrs.
Brown&rsquo;s wishes, he expressed much pleasure, and a strong
desire that it should be so tested. He wished that it might
be during the current week, if possible, as he expected to
leave home the first of the week following, to be absent
for several months. I informed Mrs. B. that evening of
my interview with Mr. Post, when she appointed Saturday
evening, and desired me to inform Mr. Post of the
fact, as he would call on me the following day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brown called at my office about 11.30 <span class="lower">A.M.</span>, and
informed me that she had been directed by the Spirits to
have Mr. John Hilton present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I accompanied Mrs. B. to the home of Mr. Post, at
245 South Sixth Street, Jersey City, on the evening appointed.
We arrived there about eight o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span> They
were requested to make a thorough examination, in order
to satisfy themselves that neither Mrs. B. nor myself had
any phosphorus about us. Mrs. B. retired to a private
room with the ladies, who disrobed her of every article of
clothing, and furnished her with an entire outfit from their
own wardrobe. After this they dressed and reconducted
her to the room in which the séance was held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the mean time the gentlemen satisfied themselves
that there was no phosphorus about my person. We assembled
in the front room up-stairs. There were present
Mr. Post, Mrs. Post, a daughter and two sons, Mr. Post&rsquo;s
sister, Mr. Hilton, Mrs. Brown, and myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After taking seats at the table, they were directed to
close and lock all the doors and windows. They were also
directed to get a bowl of water and bring in the box of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
earth, which had been procured by Messrs. Post and Hilton
during the day and sealed up by them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After sitting a few moments they were directed to
&lsquo;break the seal&rsquo; (which was done by Mr. Simeon Post).
The box was placed in front of the medium. He was then
directed by the Spirits to &lsquo;put out the light,&rsquo; which was
done. In a few moments they discovered a phosphorescent
light, emanating from the ends of Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s fingers.
Indeed, there seemed to be a vaporous exhalation
from her entire person; and after her fingers had rested
on the earth a short time, a visible fluid gradually concentrated
around Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s hands, and deposited itself
from the extremities of her fingers into the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This performance lasted about fifteen minutes. The
box was examined, and Mr. Post procured from the earth
it contained several quite large granules of phosphorus, the
purity of which was beyond question, and which he preserved,
and caused to be chemically examined and tested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. B. was then taken in charge by the ladies, and reconducted
to the dressing-room, clothed in her own attire,
and returned to the sitting-room. There was a wish expressed,
on the part of all present, to get communications
from their &lsquo;Spirit friends;&rsquo; and, although there seemed
to be a perfect willingness on the part of the medium, the
controlling Spirits deemed it advisable that there should
be no further manifestations on that night, and said,
through raps, &lsquo;It would be wrong to permit different
classes of Spirits to manifest under existing circumstances.
I will bring about another meeting soon.<br />
<span class="sign1">&lsquo;Benjamin Franklin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p class="r2">Mr. Underhill and I were married on the second day
of November, 1858, at No. 35 Nineteenth Street, New
York City. My father had taken the house of Mr. Horace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Greeley, who made it his home with my parents when he
was in the city. We were married by the Rev. John Pierpont.
Mr. U. purchased the house we now live in, and
we moved into it immediately on our return from a western
excursion. It was agreed upon that his friends should
be mine, and my friends should be his, but that I should
never again sit in public circles.</p>

<p>He thought I had done my duty faithfully, and that it
was time for me to retire from public séances. The announcement
fell like a thunderbolt upon nearly all of my
investigators. Many argued that it was a duty I owed to
the public, and to my God, to continue to labor in the
cause of Spiritualism; that I had been chosen, by higher
authorities, to do a work that rested on me and my family.
Some of my friends thought differently, and as they knew
the man who had so generously acquitted me of all blame
or suspicion, and who so nobly sustained me through the
difficulties with which I was destined to contend, my true
friends congratulated me and rejoiced at my good fortune.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER STATEMENT FROM D. UNDERHILL.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sunday Night</span>, August 1, 1859.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We retired about eleven o&rsquo;clock. I had locked the
door opening from the hall into the front room, also the
door leading from the same hall into the bath-room. The
door leading from the hall to the bed-room was locked on
the inside by Leah; but after retiring she was in doubt as
to whether she had locked it; whereupon I arose and
went to the door, tried the lock, and found it fast. I then
returned to bed. In a few moments we were startled by
the springing of the bolt of the lock of that door. Leah
exclaimed, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but
the springing of the bolt of the lock;&rsquo; supposing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
when I turned the knob the bolt had failed to spring into
its proper place. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is something more
than that.&rsquo; Very soon we heard sounds, as if Spirits were
on their knees on the floor patting the carpet with their
hands. I commenced asking questions, and received responses
by the same sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was soon evident that one or more Spirits were
around our bed. My questions were answered by a hand
patting me on the head. Soon something was passed over
our faces, just touching us, after which lights appeared
over us. They passed to my side of the bed, and a cloth
was placed upon my right shoulder and pressed heavily&mdash;at
times as with two hands; also on the arm. When the
pressure left my arm the light again appeared on or over
us, waving about us, as if to gather force from the atmosphere.
During all this time hands were distinctly visible
holding the cloth with a bright phosphorescent light upon
it. Then the sheet with which I was covered was drawn
down and the cloth was placed upon my stomach and
chest. On feeling it with my hands, I found it was a
coarse towel. Repeated pressures were made in this way
for some time, after which there was an alarm of fire in
the neighborhood. I dressed myself, and went out, returning
in about half an hour. On my return I again locked
the door and extinguished the light, and went to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My attention was attracted to a bright light on the
floor, when, at the same time, Leah noticed a bright,
flashing light, rising from the mantel, and showing the
picture over it distinctly. She called my attention to it.
The foot-board of the bedstead obstructed my view, but on
rising I noticed several lights, also one which appeared
above the mantel. I arose and went to satisfy myself
that there were no matches lying around, when, reaching
the spot, I found the light was very brilliant, and emitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a strong phosphorescent vapor. Placing my hand upon
one of the lights, I found it to be a small granule of phosphorus,
comparing exactly with those which we had before
found deposited in the earth. Several of these granules
were lying near by, and also in the candelabrum on
the end of the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was about to resume my place in bed, the alphabet
was called for, and the Spirit spelled out, &lsquo;Look in
the fire-place.&rsquo; On looking I discovered a number of
pieces or granules of phosphorus on the bricks inside of
the fire-place, which was closed tightly with a screen or
summer-piece. The Spirits said they had placed them
there to avoid damage or danger, as my getting up and
going out had disturbed the forces too suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few evenings afterward, there were again manifestations
of phosphorus, which were so strong that I was
fearful they might set fire to the bed, and as a matter of
precaution, I procured a pail of water and placed it beside
the bed. It was then spelled, &lsquo;Keep passive, and there
will be no danger.&rsquo; I was then directed to place paper
and pencil under the bed, which I did, and very soon we
heard the scratching of the pencil on the paper, which
was badly scorched, and a third part of it burned; but
the writing was plainly visible. The paper was lost, and
I do not now remember the communication written upon
it. The Spirits said, however, that the scorching of the
paper was caused by the forces being too strong.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Saturday Night</span>, July 31, 1859.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span> Leah and myself were in the
second story. I was sitting by the front window, leaning
my hand against the casement, dozing. Leah had passed
into the back room, and was returning to the front room,
when she was startled by heavy tramping, apparently close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
behind her. The sound was similar to that of a person
walking in wooden shoes. She called to me. I started,
and met her in the middle room. When Leah stopped
walking the footsteps ceased, but as soon as she commenced
again the same heavy steps kept pace with her. We
passed into the front room, where she called me to try a
test. She sat down in a high chair, and I seated myself
on the floor, in front of her, taking her feet on my knees.
Very soon the same sounds were produced on the floor
beside her chair; showing very clearly that the sounds
were produced independently of her, not even causing any
nervous start or electric motion on her part.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The frequency of the appearance of <em>lights</em>, or luminous appearances,
at séances, is suggestive of the idea that Spirits often employ, in their
manifestations, phosphorus in some form or condition&mdash;phosphorus
probably drawn from the atmosphere, or from the brains of the medium
or sitters, or both, through their higher knowledge of the secrets
and resources of the chemistry of nature. That they should know also
how to make it inodorous is easily conceivable. I have never perceived
(though in this the author of &ldquo;The Missing Link&rdquo; thinks she has sometimes
done so) any of the phosphoric odor as accompanying those
exhibitions of Spirit lights, though sometimes the entire forms of Spirits
appear as what I may call phosphorically luminous. That human brains
are, to some extent at least, natural reservoirs, from which they draw
or elaborate some basis of phosphorus, seems probable enough&mdash;or at
least should be so to those philosophers who strive to approximate phosphorus
to thought, and bid us eat phosphoric food to stimulate our wits,
and fancy they catch a gleam of it in the brightening of the eye. It is
reliably recorded that at the famous séances of Count de Bullet, at which
the controlling Spirit is known by the conventional name of &ldquo;John
King,&rdquo; he constantly appeared holding what seemed a round, white,
luminous stone, whose light would gradually fade out after a while, till
almost invisible, when he would either withdraw for a moment or two
into the cabinet, where the medium was asleep in trance, and return
with his lamp re-illumined, or else apply the <em>stone</em>, called his &lsquo;lamp,&rsquo; to
the forehead of the Count de Bullet, when the light would be seen to
rapidly resume its full brightness. The first effect of such application
to the forehead, was that <em>dark clouds of wreathing smoke</em> would seem to
enter into the stone from the forehead, soon to pass into pervading light;
strong in close proximity, but, like phosphoric light, not radiating to
much distance. That the Spirits should be able to elaborate the cerebral,
or atmospheric, or terrestrial phosphorus into the condition of solid particles
of granulated phosphorus, is not difficult to conceive, but I do not
know of any other instance of their having actually done it, under human
observation, than that now related by Mrs. Underhill.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">BOSTON AND THE HARVARD PROFESSORS, 1857.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Agreement for an Investigation by a Committee of Harvard
Professors&mdash;Expulsion of a Student from the Divinity
School for the Crime of Mediumship&mdash;Professor Felton&mdash;Agassiz&mdash;Varley,
the Electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph
Company.</p>


<p>On the 16th day of June, 1857, we left our home in New
York, at the earnest solicitation of friends in Boston, to
attend an investigation which had been arranged in accordance
with the following note:</p>


<h3>THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned, hereby agree to submit the question
in controversy between us in regard to the phenomena
of Spiritualism, so called, to the investigation and award
of the Committee, consisting of Professors Agassiz, Pierce,
and Horsford, and Dr. Gould, according to the terms of
the paper annexed.</p>

<p class="sgn4"><cite>Boston Courier</cite>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by <span class="smcap">George Lunt.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;F. Gardner.</span><br /></p>

<p class="sgn5">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, June 9, 1857.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center f9">DR. GARDNER&rsquo;S CONDITIONS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meeting to be held in a suitable room in the city of
Boston, to continue six days, or a longer time if desirable,
and two hours each day to be devoted to the investigation,
commencing at 4 and closing at 6 o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the arrangements and details for the forming of the
circles to be entirely under the control of Dr. Gardner, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the Committee may remain out of the circle so
formed if they choose to do so. If the phenomena are
produced under the arrangements as ordered by Dr. Gardner,
and they are not satisfactory to the Committee, they
shall have the right to require them to be produced under
such conditions as in their judgment will be satisfactory to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As harmony is an essential condition for the production
of the manifestations, it is agreed that no loud talking
or exciting debate or other unnecessary noise shall be
allowed in the rooms during the sessions, and that each
person present shall be treated with that respect and courtesy
which is due from each person to every other in the
society of <span class="lower">GENTLEMEN</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be present at each session the writer in the
<cite>Boston Courier</cite>, and a friend, and the four gentlemen
composing the Committee of Investigation, Dr. Gardner,
and any number of persons not exceeding six at any one
time, at his option, such being selected and invited by Dr.
Gardner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The writer in the <cite>Courier</cite>, and the gentlemen composing
the Committee, agree that, while they are at liberty
to exercise all the shrewdness and powers of observation
which they are capable during the investigation, they will
not exercise their will power to endeavor to prevent the
manifestations, but allow them to be produced under the
most favorable conditions which a thorough scientific investigation
will permit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The words &lsquo;to be provided by Dr. Gardner&rsquo; first being
stricken out, and the words &lsquo;and a friend&rsquo; inserted, it is
further understood that the proceedings are not to be published
until the investigations are closed.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;F. Gardner.</span>&rdquo;<br /></p>
</div>


<p class="cl">We questioned, at that time, the propriety of leaving
New York to attend to this request, as to do so would necessarily
cause us to break our engagements at home. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
as to the contest between the professors of Harvard College
and the Boston Spiritualists, mediums, etc., we cared
very little at that time whether they (the professors) should
pronounce for or against us, and for this reason: that it
may be safely averred that while intelligent, scientific
minds, honestly and studiously devoted to their legitimate
labors and investigations, have been, and are, glorious pioneers
in the advancement of human knowledge, <em>there are
subjects</em> touching which scholastic eminence furnishes but
a poor outfit for special and honest investigation. But we
had met the equals of these Boston and Harvard professors
long ere this; and here let me add we seldom received enlightenment
through scientific opponents. Many successful
experiments had been made by honest, intelligent, and
educated investigators, which proved, beyond all cavil,
what <em>their science</em> could not fathom&mdash;and did not wish to.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, I doubt not, that Professor
Eustis, of the Scientific School, once caught the foot of a
Divinity student out of its proper place under the table,
and that the said professor cried &ldquo;fraud,&rdquo; and brought an
accusation against the student before the governing faculty
of the university, who, in their high wisdom, knowing not
what they did, expelled the young man for the &ldquo;heinous
crime of owning an erratic foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am unable to state here at what time this occurrence
took place, but the public press, at that time, very extensively
condemned the action of the collegiate authorities in
that case; and, in doing this, Spiritualism necessarily came
more or less in for consideration. Great doubt was expressed,
in the press editorials of the day, of the honesty
of the professors in thus expelling the student without
giving him an opportunity to prove his integrity. The
expulsion of this young Divinity student was simply because
he was a Spiritualist and a medium, and refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
abandon the sacred truth which he had learned and tested
in his own person; and it was in the full spirit of the old
New England persecutions for honest opinion obnoxious
to dominant authority; which, fortunately, had no longer
the power to hang or burn. But the world moves, after
all, in spite of such persecutions, to which history soon does
the justice it has rendered to Galileo; and the leading
scientific journal of New England, published at Cambridge
itself, an organ of the Scientific faculty of Harvard, has
recently put itself in the line of modern progress in reference
to this very subject of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>Fierce and rude attacks were made in the columns of
<cite>The Boston Courier</cite>, <em>by these professors</em>, upon mediums,
Spiritualists, and all who had any faith in the phenomena;
insinuating at the time that, &ldquo;If mediums believed in
themselves, they would only be too eager to exhibit their
powers before those who are most sceptical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reply to these attacks Dr. Gardner made the following
proposition, viz., That a committee of twelve disinterested
men shall be selected by the principal editors of <cite>The
Boston Journal</cite>, <cite>The Boston Courier</cite>, and <cite>The Daily Traveller</cite>,
which committee shall arrange all the preliminaries
of the discussion, and decide upon the strength of the arguments,
adduced for and against the Spiritual origin of the
various forms of manifestations of the present day, usually
denominated Spiritual.</p>

<p>The challenge to a public discussion was declined, but in
lieu of it the following statement appeared in <cite>The Courier</cite>,
which was well understood to have proceeded from Professor
Felton, of Harvard:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will pay $500 to Dr. Gardner, to Mrs. Henderson,
to Mrs. Hatch, or to Mr. or Mrs. anybody else who will
communicate a single word imparted to the &lsquo;Spirits&rsquo; by
us, in an adjoining room; who will read a single word, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
English, written inside a book, or sheet of paper, folded
in such a manner as we may choose; who will answer,
with the aid of all the higher intelligences he or she can
invoke from the other world, <em>three questions</em>&mdash;which the
superior intelligences must be able to answer, if what they
said in <cite>The Melodeon</cite> was true; and we will not require
Dr. Gardner or the mediums to risk a single cent on the
experiment. If one or all of them can do one of these
things, the five hundred dollars shall be paid on the spot.
If they fail, they shall pay nothing; not even the expense
incident to trying the experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately on receipt of this challenge from the professors,
Dr. Gardner replied, &ldquo;Now, Mr. Editor, I accept
the offer, as I do also the distinguished gentlemen named
as the committee, provided the person or persons making
the offer will agree to let all of the conditions of the arrangement
come within the scope of those natural laws
within which we believe Spirits are confined in producing
the manifestations above referred to; and I will meet the
person or persons making the offer at any time and place,
after next Sabbath, which he or they may name, to make
such arrangements as are necessary to a thorough and
scientific test of this great subject.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;H.&nbsp;F. Gardner.</span><br />
<span class="sign3a">&ldquo;May 27, 1857.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>The committee named in the <cite>Courier</cite> was George Lunt
(editor of that paper), Prof. Benjamin Pierce, chairman,
Prof. Agassiz, Prof. Horsford, and Dr. A.&nbsp;B. Gould.</p>

<p>The place of meeting was in the upper room of the Albion
Building, corner of Tremont and Beacon Streets,
Boston.</p>

<p>I and Katie accepted an invitation to go to Boston to
lend our contribution to this investigation, with disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
self-sacrifice for the sake of the cause, and in support
of Dr. Gardner, one of the best of men and Spiritualists,
who thus stood forward as its representative and champion.
I may mention that this was anterior, not subsequent to the
Phosphorus affair related in the preceding chapter. There
were present Miss Kendrick, George A. Redman, J.&nbsp;V.
Mansfield, the Davenport brothers, Katie and myself&mdash;mediums.</p>

<p>The committee of Spiritualists were Mr. Allan Putnam,
Dr. Gardner, Major G. Washington Rains.</p>

<p>At the first meeting Dr. Gardner expressed his dissatisfaction
with the idea of a penalty of $500, or of any money,
to be paid by the <cite>Courier</cite>, and this seemed to meet unanimous
approval; so that no ground remained for the position
afterward taken by the professors, that they had to make
an award, as stakeholders and judges, of $500 on the presentation
of certain specific phenomena laid in Prof. Felton&rsquo;s
original (unsigned) article in the <cite>Courier</cite>, while the
document above quoted, of June 9, 1857, between the
<cite>Courier</cite> and Dr. Gardner, is conclusive to the effect that
it was to be a general scientific investigation. It will be
seen below how the professors afterward quibbled over
this point, and avoided making a report of any results, but
only an &ldquo;award&rdquo; that the $500 was not claimable, because
the specific phenomena originally put forward by Prof.
Felton had not been exhibited; while at the same time
promising a future report, which report they <em>never came
up to the scratch of making</em>. It was generally understood
that a draft of a report had been proposed by a portion
of them, but suppressed because deemed more &ldquo;damaging
to Christianity&rdquo; than one favorable to Spiritualism. So
that Harvard has ever since remained under the odium and
ridicule of never having made a report, of which, in what
they called an &ldquo;award,&rdquo; it had recognized that the duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
was incumbent on the professors, and which they had expressly
promised to make. It was in vain that for months
and years the Spiritualist papers of Boston clamored for
the promised report, and jeered at those who evidently
found it impossible to make one which should not be more
or less favorable to Spiritualism.</p>

<p>This meeting, to my mind, was very unsatisfactory.
I was astonished and disappointed at the course which the
professors pursued. Astonished at their seeming ignorance
of all laws of order and harmony, and disappointed to find
that they had met, determined to establish some appearance
of carrying their point, right or wrong.</p>

<p>They fell far beneath the degree of intelligence we had
met on so many former occasions, in connection with the
phenomenal manifestations associated with Spiritualism.
Our investigating committees had always heretofore been
chosen with reference to their intellectual competency and
honorable character; whose reports were expected to enlighten
thousands who were unable to make such experiments
themselves. But I am quite sure, from the experience
I have had, that a great majority of those highly conceited
professors, many of whom were of quite ordinary
talent, had, to some extent, overcome the deficiencies of
nature by turning their attention in one direction of specific
study only.</p>

<p>On all other subjects, they are ordinary, and often very
ordinary men. Professor Agassiz conversed with me
pleasantly, and I was attracted to him, and admired him
greatly; <em>but I knew he was wanting in courage</em>, the courage
of being ready to forfeit or endanger his great <em>position</em>
in Harvard and the country. I incline to the theory presented
by Mr. Allan Putnam in 1874, in his pamphlet
on &ldquo;Agassiz and Spiritualism,&rdquo; that Agassiz at this investigation
was in a false position, which gives him claims to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
our indulgence. In his earlier life, when a professor in
Switzerland, he had been thrown under the mesmeric spell
by the Rev. Chauncy Hare Townshend, and at this investigation
was under mysterious conflicting influences, of which
his better self was perhaps unconscious, and for which it
was not responsible. (See the pamphlet referred to, published
by Colby and Rich, Boston.)</p>

<p>He said to me, &ldquo;Mrs. Brown, I have seen the day I could
do everything you do.&rdquo; I replied to this, &ldquo;Very well,
Professor: if you can do all that is done through me, you
are a Medium,&rdquo; and I at once challenged him, in friendship
and good-will, to take the stand (in the presence of their
committee) with me, and submit himself to the same tests
I would, adding that unless he could do all that the Spirits
could do through me, I should claim the victory.</p>

<p>He replied, &ldquo;My physical condition is much changed
now.&rdquo; I did not at that time know that he had formerly
been a mesmeric subject, and had been made clairvoyant,
and given positive proof of his mediumship long years before
I knew anything about Spirit rappings, magnetism, or
anything relating to the subject. He positively refused to
have anything to do further in connection with the examination
at that time, and remained with me, aside, during
the investigation going on at the time with others.</p>

<p>Prof. Agassiz noticed that my attention was somewhat
absorbed in the movements of Prof. Pierce (as he wandered
about so restlessly, and seemed very much troubled;
I trying to study him out), and said to me, &ldquo;Mrs.
Brown, what do you think of Prof. Pierce?&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;If he were boxed up in such a way that I could see nothing
but his lower extremities, and the manner in which he
plants his feet on the ground, I could read his character correctly.&rdquo;
He laughed and said, &ldquo;I think you do not read
him favorably.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he is not an honest man.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Agassiz did not dare to sit in a circle and subject
himself to the influence or power of magnetism, as may be
seen in a quotation from &ldquo;Facts of Mesmerism,&rdquo; by Rev.
Chauncy Hare Townshend, an article written by himself
and consequently correct, from which the following is extracted:</p>


<p>&ldquo;Desirous to know what to think of mesmerism, I for
a long time sought for an opportunity of making some experiments
in regard to it upon myself, so as to avoid the
doubts which might arise on the nature of the sensations
which we have heard described by mesmerized persons.
M. Desor, yesterday, in a visit which he made to Berne,
invited Mr. Townshend, who had previously mesmerized
him, to accompany him to Neufchatel and try to mesmerize
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These gentlemen arrived here with the evening courier,
and informed me of their arrival. At eight o&rsquo;clock I went
to them. We continued at supper till half-past nine
o&rsquo;clock, and about ten Mr. Townshend commenced operating
on me. While we sat opposite to each other, he, in
the first place, only took hold of my hands and looked at
me fixedly. I was firmly resolved to arrive at a knowledge
of the truth, whatever it might be; and therefore,
the moment I saw him endeavoring to exert an action
upon me, <em>I silently addressed the Author of all things, beseeching
him to give me the power to resist the influence,
and to be conscientious in regard to myself, as well as in
regard to the facts</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then fixed my eyes upon Mr. Townshend, attentive
to whatever passed. I was in very suitable circumstances:
the hour being early, and one at which I was in the habit
of studying, was far from disposing me to sleep. I was
sufficiently master of myself to experience no emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and to repress all flights of imagination, even if I had
been less calm; accordingly it was a long time before I
felt any effect from the presence of Mr. Townshend opposite
me. However, after at least a quarter of an hour, I
felt a sensation of a current through all my limbs, and
from that moment my eye-lids grew heavy. I then saw
Mr. Townshend extend his hands before my eyes, as if he
were about to plunge his fingers into them; and then make
different circular movements around my eyes, which caused
my eye-lids to become still heavier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the idea that he was endeavoring to make me
close my eyes, and yet it was not as if some one had
threatened my eyes, and in the waking state I had closed
them to prevent him. It was an irresistible heaviness of
the lids which compelled me to shut them, and, by degrees,
I found that I had no longer the power of keeping them
open, but did not the less retain my consciousness of what
was going on around me, so that I heard M. Desor speak
to Mr. Townshend, understood what they said, and heard
what questions they asked me, just as if I had been awake,
but I had not the power of answering. I endeavored in
vain several times to do so, and, when I succeeded, I
perceived that I was passing out of the state of torpor in
which I had been, and which was rather agreeable than
painful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this state, I heard the watchman cry ten o&rsquo;clock;
then I heard it strike a quarter-past; but afterward I fell
into a deeper sleep, although I never entirely lost my consciousness.
It appeared to me that Mr. Townshend was
endeavoring to put me into a sound sleep. My movements
seemed under his control; for I wished several
times to change the position of my arms, but had not sufficient
power to do it, or even really to will it; while I felt
my head carried to the right or left shoulder, and backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
or forward, without wishing it, and, indeed, in spite
of the resistance which I endeavored to oppose; and this
happened several times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I experienced at the same time a feeling of great
pleasure in giving way to the attraction which dragged me
sometimes to one side, sometimes to the other; then a
kind of surprise on feeling my head fall into Mr. Townshend&rsquo;s
hand, who appeared to me from that time to be
the cause of the attraction. To his inquiry if I were well,
and what I felt, I found I could not answer, but I smiled;
I felt that my features expanded in spite of my resistance.
I was inwardly confused at experiencing pleasure <em>from an
influence which was mysterious to me</em>. From this moment
I wished to wake, and was less at my ease; and yet, on
Mr. Townshend asking me whether I wished to be awakened,
I made a hesitating movement with my shoulders.
Mr. Townshend then repeated some frictions which increased
my sleep, yet I was always conscious of what was
passing around me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He then asked me if I wished to become lucid, at the
same time continuing, as I felt, the frictions from the face
to the arms. I then experienced an indescribable sensation
of delight, and for an instant saw before me rays of
dazzling light, which instantly disappeared. I was then
inwardly sorrowful at this state being prolonged. It appeared
to me that enough had been done with me. I
wished to awake, but could not; yet when Mr. Townshend
and Mr. Desor spoke, I heard them. I also heard the
clock, and the watchman cry, but I did not know what
hour he cried. Mr. Townshend then presented his watch
to me, and asked me if I could see the time, and if I saw
him; but I could distinguish nothing. I heard the clock
strike the quarter, but could not get out of my sleepy state.
Mr. Townshend then woke me with some quick transverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
movements from the middle of the face outward, which
instantly caused my eyes to open; and at the same time I
got up, saying to him, &lsquo;I thank you.&rsquo; It was a quarter
past eleven. He then told me&mdash;and M. Desor repeated
the same thing&mdash;that the only fact which had satisfied
them that I was in a state of mesmeric sleep was the facility
with which my head followed all the movements of his
hand, although he did not touch me, and the pleasure
which I appeared to feel at the moment when, after several
repetitions of friction, he thus moved my head at
pleasure.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">&ldquo;(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Agassiz</span>.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>On the above quoted statement of Agassiz himself, Mr.
Allan Putnam, in his pamphlet on &ldquo;Agassiz and Spiritualism,&rdquo;
remarks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are distinctly taught, in the above (see pages 6,
7, 8, and 9), that as philosopher and scientist, then in the
full vigor of manhood, Agassiz &lsquo;had for a long time
sought&rsquo; for such an opportunity to be mesmerized as Dr.
Townshend&rsquo;s visit afforded. This professor, even then
eminent&mdash;this man, gifted with gigantic mental and strong
physical powers&mdash;reverently and prayerfully, as well as
philosophically, sat calmly down, not to welcome and imbibe,
but &lsquo;<em>to resist the mesmeric influence</em>.&rsquo; Then Greek
met Greek, scientist met scientist, in calm but resolute
measurement of the strength and efficiency of their respective
weapons and forces. Agassiz says his purpose was to
<em>resist</em>. The whole tone of his account, however, indicates
that his resistance was in no degree captious, but designed
simply to measure the strength and enable him to note the
action of mesmeric force. The vigorous professor then
called into exercise all his own great inherent powers of
resistance, and such further aid as his earnest aspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
could bring to his support, and yet was forced to yield up
to another&rsquo;s will all command over his own physical organs.
A stronger than he entered and ruled over his peculiar
domain. The Author of all things, though besought, did
not so co-operate as to countervail the legitimate action of
natural powers. Invisible forces, emitted and directed by
another man&rsquo;s mind, against which his own robust intellect
was planted in calm and firm resistance, penetrated even
the compact Agassiz, and caused him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;1st. To feel the sensation of a current through all his
limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2d. To close his eye-lids from necessity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3d. To lose his powers of utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4th. To lose power to change the position of his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5th. To lose power to even <em>will</em> to move his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;6th. To lack power to prevent movements of his own
head by another&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;7th. To experience great pleasure in giving way to the
attraction upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;8th. To feel surprised at the contact of his head with
another&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;9th. To find the operator the cause of the attraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;10th. To be confused at experiencing <em>pleasure</em> from an
influence that was <em>mysterious</em> to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;11th. To see for an instant dazzling rays of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;12th. To be unable to awake, even though he wished
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Similar experiences have become so common that they
are now devoid of strangeness. Thousands, possibly hundreds
of thousands, have had their like since 1839. But
no other Agassiz has described the sensations and facts attending
the subduing operations. The character of their
reporter gives his experiences exceptional value.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true and readily admitted that this keen and exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
observer was then dominated by <em>mesmeric</em>, which many
assume to be widely different from <em>Spirit</em>, force. The belief
is prevalent to-day that those two adjectives describe
one and the same thing. Few persons who have sought to
discover the relations between mesmerism and Spiritualism,
hesitate to indorse the following statement, made by Cromwell
F. Varley before a committee of the London Dialectical
Society, which was substantially this, viz., &lsquo;I believe
that the mesmeric force and the Spiritual force are the
same&mdash;the only difference being that in one case the producing
agent is in a material body, and in the other is out
of such a body.&rsquo; Mr. Varley&rsquo;s competency to give a valuable
opinion may be inferred from the fact that the great
Atlantic Telegraph Company elected him from among
England&rsquo;s eminent electricians, to supervise and control
the constructors and operators of their vast and delicate
apparatus for flashing knowledge under the waters, from
continent to continent, and he made their project a success.
We add, that Spiritualism had, for years, been manifested
in striking forms and much distinctness, both through
himself and other members of his own family, and that he
had been an extensive observer and scientific student of its
phenomena, and a careful tester of its forces. He had
reached the conclusion, not only that the chief force employed
in producing both the mesmeric and the Spiritualistic
entrancement was the same, but also that it was
distinct from either electricity or magnetism. From Mr.
Varley&rsquo;s views the conclusion may be fairly deduced that
Agassiz, in middle life, experienced much that is undistinguishable
from the sensations and perceptions of modern
mediums, and that he was subdued by use of the same
force by which they are controlled. As a general rule,
though possibly subject to a few exceptions, persons who
have once yielded to mesmeric, afterward are very liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
to succumb to Spirit force. This rule will have important
bearings when we come to view the deportment of Agassiz
as a member of the Harvard investigating committee.
What we have already adduced suggests the probability
that, if unresisted by himself, Spirits could have controlled
him with much facility, had he consented to be calm
and unresisting while he was within the auras or spheres
of persons whose emanations and constituent elements
were helpful to the control of physical forms by Spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great naturalist probably was mesmerized at other
times than the one of which his own pen furnished an account.
For Townshend, p.&nbsp;344, says: &ldquo;Prof. Agassiz, who,
when mesmerized, could not of himself stir a muscle, moved
like an automaton across the room when impelled by me.
Even while retaining his consciousness enough <em>to resist my
efforts</em> to move his limbs by mere gestures, without contact
of any kind, he subsequently owned that he was actually
compelled into such motions as I wished him to perform.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">BOSTON AND THE HARVARD PROFESSORS (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Disinterested Judgments upon the Sham Investigation&mdash;Our
Part in the Proceedings&mdash;More Fair Investigation by the
Collective Representatives of the New England Press&mdash;Investigation
by a Body of Unitarian Clergymen&mdash;Our Triumphant
Return Home&mdash;Theodore Parker.</p>


<p>Not only would Prof. Agassiz not sit in circle with us,
saying that he had vowed never again to sit in a circle, but
he would not even consent to go into a private room with
the medium, Mr. Redman, who invited him to do so when
he found that the powerfully adverse influence of hostile
wills and feelings strained against him, in the room in
which sat the professors and the representative of <cite>The
Courier</cite>, paralyzed his ability to exhibit the phenomena
which, under normal circumstances, were familiar and invariable
with him.</p>

<p>It is evident that all this was a mere sham &ldquo;investigation.&rdquo;
<cite>The Boston Traveller</cite> said after it, that &ldquo;It is <em>the
unanimous opinion</em> of those who witnessed the whole proceedings,
with the exception of the representative of <cite>The
Courier</cite>, that the whole affair was in no sense of the word
an investigation, and that nothing was proved or disproved
by it.&rdquo; And without quoting from other (non-Spiritualist)
papers, I will only add from <cite>The Cambridge Chronicle</cite> of
July 11th, issued under the shadow of old Harvard&rsquo;s edifices,
and circulated through its halls and dormitories, the
following comments by a correspondent: &ldquo;It is patent to
observation that the committee approached the subject with
preconceived views. They seem to have taken for granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that they knew more on the subject, even without investigation,
than the unscientific Spiritualists with all their
long experience and heart interest in it; and they erroneously
judged that the public would take their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i> with
unreasoning deference. Because a man knows a rock, does
it follow that he knows a star? or if he knows a star, does
he know a Spirit? Their professors have shown their ignorance
in this &lsquo;investigation,&rsquo; nothing more,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>I may say, with specific reference to the part of the
&ldquo;two Fox sisters,&rdquo; that in spite of the bad influences upon
us of the bitterly hostile spirit which ruled the so-called
&ldquo;investigation,&rdquo; and the contemptuous ill-temper often
manifested by some of the committee, I had no reason to
be dissatisfied with the part played by our Spirit friends.
Our rappings came, if not as profusely as usual, yet abundantly,
both low and loud, in spite of our being moved to
different parts of the room, of our being placed standing
on cushions and on the stuffed spring seat of a sofa, etc.
Their demonstrative effect was broken by Agassiz&rsquo;s assurances
that he could show how these could be produced by
natural physiological means, and his pledge that he would
do so, a pledge given in the collective form of &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and
therefore binding on the body whose silence was assent to
them. And yet on the last day, after he had in haste left
the room, and when Dr. Gardner called for the fulfilment
of this engagement, Prof. Pierce, who had presided,
wriggled out of it by the plea that that was only an individual
promise by Prof. Agassiz, and <em>not one by the committee</em>.
Of course it would have been easy to recall Agassiz,
or to hold another meeting for the purpose. Nor was that
pledge ever after redeemed, in spite of the calls of the
Spiritualist press. Nor could the great Agassiz have more
eloquently admitted the impossibility of its fulfilment, than
he did by such silence under such circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th of July, 1857, Mr. Allan Putnam, of Roxbury,
published a statement from which I extract the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brown and her sister, Miss C. Fox, were present
as mediums. A conversation was started which was carried
on mostly, but not entirely, by Mr. Lunt, the representative
of <cite>The Courier</cite>, and Major Rains, of Newburg,
N.&nbsp;Y., a graduate of West Point, once assistant professor
there, and who, in connection with Judge Edmonds and
others, made a long-continued investigation of Spiritual
powers scientifically. This conversation related to the instrumentality
and processes by which Spirits work, and
Major Rains expressed some of his views as to the proper
processes for a scientific investigation of this particular
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also, there was conversation, mostly between Professor
Agassiz and Mrs. Brown, as to when and how the Fox
family first learned that they possessed this mediumistic
susceptibility. The substance of this harmonized with
what has often been published.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a time, the mediums and a few others being at
the table, raps were heard, mostly on the floor (or rather
upon a three or four inch platform covering the stuffed or
deadened floor), while a few gentle ones were felt and
heard as if made on the table. Afterward, when Mrs.
Brown stood by a large wooden box, and put first her
finger and then a common pencil against the box, the raps
were heard there as on the box and near her hand. Again,
when she stood upon a covered stool, the sounds seemed
to be made beneath her on the platform. Again, when
the two mediums were both standing on the stuffed seat of
a sofa, the persons near them remarked that they heard
sounds as from the wood of the sofa, and also from the
wall against which the sofa stood. My position was distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
from the sofa, and I only state what others who were near
remarked. Many of the raps upon the platform and one
or two upon the box were quite distinctly heard in most
parts of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near the close of their sitting, Prof. Agassiz stated
that the production of such sounds could be referred to
known laws, and said, &lsquo;Before the investigation is over
we will explain to you how they may be produced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When about to separate, Major Rains expressed a wish
that all would stop and compare notes, and come to an
agreement as to what had actually occurred or been exhibited.
A few sentences as to the propriety or importance
of this course were exchanged between him and
Prof. Pierce, when the Professor said, with a very ironical
and discourteous tone and look, &lsquo;We thank you, sir,
for your <em>advice</em>,&rsquo; and bowing, hastily left the room. This
occurred while a portion of the company were about leaving
the room&mdash;while nearly all were standing and ready to
go&mdash;while promiscuous conversation was going on&mdash;and it
is not probable that many heard or saw what is here described.
I was standing by the side of Major Rains, and
saw and heard the whole most distinctly. Mortified and
ashamed at the tones and looks of this representative of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma Mater</i> and of Science, when addressed to a gentleman
stranger, and a man of science, I turned silently away,
and was not surprised when, shortly after, Major Rains said
to me, &lsquo;There seems no occasion for me to remain here
because of any knowledge or skill which my experience in
such investigations may have given me; there is no attempt,
no purpose, to have an investigation of the general
subject. I had better return home.&rsquo; And soon he did go,
as then proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the &lsquo;change came o&rsquo;er the spirit of my dream.&rsquo;
At the next gathering I asked, privately, and learned from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
both Prof. Pierce and Mr. Gould, that they considered
the money question as still before them, and that they
were but judges and not investigators. From that time
my relations to them and to that particular trial became
relatively unpleasant. I had little to do or say, and
nothing to hope for, because of the necessary antagonism
in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At their next sitting Mr. Redman was the medium.
Raps and tipping of the table did not come as they
usually do with him; yet he asked those at the table to
write the names of deceased friends and roll up the
slips. Prof. Pierce commenced writing in a book. Prof.
Agassiz, in the meanwhile, was standing near his back,
frequently changing his own attitude and position, and
looking very intently upon Redman, although he said to
Prof. Pierce, &lsquo;Throw that one out,&rsquo; meaning the slip just
written upon. There was the appearance of much mental
disturbance in Prof. Agassiz, as shown by his attitudes,
his changes of position, his wild gaze, and his tones
when he spoke. No raps came, <em>nothing</em> claiming to be
Spiritual was done by or through Mr. Redman in the public
room. At some time during this sitting Dr. Gardner
drew attention to the points of disturbance, through strong
mental action and intent use of the eyes. Mr. Lunt was
understood to say that he had been using both mind and
eyes intently, and with much effect; but I was on the opposite
side of the room from him when he spoke, and may
not have taken in the exact import of his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Similar want of success attended the other mediums, at
all the subsequent sittings up to the meeting of the Davenports,
on the last evening. These boys, or young men,
were intrusted almost entirely to the management of the
Committee, and those of us who were but spectators are
not so informed as to make it proper to state in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the Committee what was attempted nor what the success.
We do know that at the close Prof. Agassiz held
up a small, short piece of thread, which he said had
been &lsquo;<em>broken</em>,&rsquo; and that that was the <em>test</em>. Having uttered
these words in a very rough tone and emphatic manner,
he, in a similar tone, said, &lsquo;Good night, gentlemen,&rsquo; and
hastily left us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prof. Pierce then said to Dr. Gardner, &lsquo;I suppose you
are through with us.&rsquo; The Doctor replied, &lsquo;No, you have
promised to show us how the raps were made.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
as a Committee,&rsquo; said Prof. Pierce; &lsquo;Mr. Agassiz made
that promise as an individual.&rsquo; And thus the affair closed&mdash;we
as much disappointed at the failure of Agassiz to
keep his word and unveil the mystery of rapping, as at
any one failure during the sittings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>Investigation</em>, in fact, was a trial of the correctness
of the statements made at the preliminary meeting, viz.,
&lsquo;that it was in the power of the gentlemen there present
to make the trial a failure, by ejecting certain forces from
their own minds and eyes.&rsquo; In this they were successful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of the gentlemen, Prof. Agassiz and Mr. Lunt,
omitted throughout all the sessions to comply with invitations
to sit in the circle around the table, and there was
not, in any instance or at any point, any opportunity for
Dr. Gardner to exercise &lsquo;the determination of all the accessory
circumstances.&rsquo; The former gentleman, it seems,
was permitted to exercise his own choice as to being in
the circle, but not so the latter. Dr. Gardner&rsquo;s friends
have been disappointed, and the chief disappointment
was at the manners and actions and mental and emotional
states of two of the Committee and a representative of <cite>The
Courier</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chickens were hatched on this occasion, where the
hen was kept in perpetual agitation, and was often driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
from her nest during the period of incubation; <em>but it does
not follow that eggs never contain a vital principle</em>. Let
the proper conditions be observed, let natural laws have
legitimate play, and the latent vital principle will take
form and embodiment and come forth from the shell a
thing of life and power. It is easy to prevent the hatching
of an egg, for the Committee did that with very little
trouble. But many hens &lsquo;steal to their nests,&rsquo; and in secluded
spots, where natural laws are conformed to, the
hatching processes still go on in spite of human science.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;Allen Putnam.</span><br />
<span class="sign3a">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Roxbury</span>, July 10, 1857.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>


<p>I must here bear testimony to the uniform politeness&mdash;I
may say kindness&mdash;with which I was personally treated
by Prof. Agassiz, however rough may have been his occasional
treatment of some of the other mediums. So far as
<em>we</em> were concerned, he exhibited nothing but that perfect
gentlemanhood which lent another grace to his mental
greatness and scientific attainment. There has always remained
on my mind the impression of something mysterious
as having clouded his general conduct in this &ldquo;investigation.&rdquo;
He was indeed in a false position, and ought
never to have been a member of that committee of professors,
inasmuch as it was of such serious importance to
Prof. Felton (afterwards president), who was virtually the
prosecuting officer against Spiritualism, and so vehement
in his public antagonism to it, and who was also so closely
connected by marriage with Agassiz, his <em>father-in-law</em> (I
believe), that a failure to support Felton in this must have
complicated family relations. I must also add that I
found Prof. Horsford unexceptionable as a kind and courteous
gentleman. I think that at the bottom of the committee&rsquo;s
strange conduct in only making an &ldquo;award&rdquo; on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
money question, which no longer existed before them, and
then remaining in the ridiculous position of never making
their promised &ldquo;report,&rdquo; notwithstanding the challenges
and the jeers of the Spiritualist papers and orators, lay,
in some degree at least, the facts of this awkwardness of
domestic difficulties, and the impossibility of getting the
professors united upon any report.</p>

<p>But that noble man, who has long since gone to his reward,
Dr. Gardner, did not let the matter drop at this
point. No sooner was the &ldquo;award&rdquo; promulgated than he
engaged his mediums to postpone their departure from the
city, and, under like circumstances, in the same room, furniture
unchanged, to repeat their sittings before a different
set of investigators, namely, the <em>representatives of the Press</em>.
A large body of these gentlemen attended, besides their
friends and other spectators, and it is sufficient for me to
say that the results were entirely satisfactory. But Dr.
Gardner had requested that their reports should be withheld
from publication until after the committee&rsquo;s full report
should have appeared.</p>

<p>In Mr. Allan Putnam&rsquo;s pamphlet above referred to
(&ldquo;Agassiz and Spiritualism&rdquo;), is given an account of this
convening of the members of the Press, by Dr. Gardner,
written by the temporary editor of <cite>The New England
Spiritualist</cite>, and signed &ldquo;One Present,&rdquo; and commencing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well known that the &lsquo;award&rsquo; of the committee
entirely failed to meet the rational demands of inquirers.
It took the form of a decree rather than a decision. Such
being the facts, Dr. Gardner thought it due, not only to
himself but to the community, to make another effort to
have the matter fairly and deliberately tested. Accordingly,
immediately after the appearance of the committee&rsquo;s
&lsquo;award,&rsquo; he invited the editors of the principal newspapers
in the city to attend the séances and witness manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
through the same mediums he had employed before the
professors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen who responded to this invitation were:
Messrs. Carter, Robinson, and Brown, of <cite>The Boston
Traveller</cite>; Stockwell, of <cite>The Journal</cite>; Bulger, of <cite>The
Post</cite>; Clapp and Shillaber, of <cite>The Gazette</cite>; Marsh, of <cite>The
Bee</cite>; Tracy, of <cite>The Herald</cite>; Hill, of <cite>The Ledger</cite>; and
the editors of <cite>The Banner of Light</cite>, and <cite>New England
Spiritualist</cite>. There were also present at a portion of the
sittings, Hon. L.&nbsp;V. Bell, A. Putnam, Esq., Alvin Adams,
Esq., and others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I extract only the following, which relates to ourselves:</p>


<h3>&ldquo;SECOND SESSION.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;At the second session, on Thursday afternoon, July
2d, Mrs. Brown and Miss Kate Fox were present as mediums.
The precaution was taken again to examine the
furniture and appliances of the room, to guard against any
mechanical trickery. The company then seating themselves,
raps were in a few moments heard upon the floor
and table. The sounds were various and complicated, from
the lightest tap to quite heavy blows. The heavier sounds
had a peculiar softness, as if they had been made by a
padded drum-stick worked by a spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next step was to test the intelligence manifested
through the sounds. The method of doing this will be
understood from the following, which is but a small part
of the proceedings&mdash;as a report of the whole would be but
a repetition of questions similar in their character, and
eliciting equivalent results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Spirit-friend of Mr. Marsh announced himself as
present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Marsh.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Will you tell me your name?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">By the sounds.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A list of names was written by Mr. M., and as he
pointed to them separately the Spirit designated that of
Le Grand Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Will you tell me the manner of your death?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lost at sea.&rsquo; (Correct.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Will you tell me where I last saw you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New York.&rsquo; (Correct.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you any other acquaintance in this room?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Clapp.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Will Mr. Marsh ask him where I last saw
him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer obtained by Mr. Marsh&mdash;&lsquo;Boston.&rsquo; (Correct.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;I have seen him when he was sick; can he
tell at what place?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Will the Spirit tell where Mr. Clapp has
seen him sick?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New York.&rsquo; (Correct.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where else?&rsquo; (No answer.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whom were you intimate with in Boston? the Chickerings?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A weak affirmative was returned, which was supposed
to indicate that he was acquainted with them&mdash;perhaps
not intimately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you know Col. N.&nbsp;A. Thompson?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any other persons in this circle?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dr. Gardner&rsquo;&mdash;and others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. G. seemed willing that all failures should pass as
such, and promptly said, &lsquo;That is a mistake, gentlemen;
I don&rsquo;t know any such person.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A desultory conversation here sprung up; after which
Mr. Marsh resumed: &lsquo;In whose employ were you when I
first knew you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jenny Lind&rsquo;s.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! is that the man? I know now. I saw
him in Springfield once; had some sharp words with him,
too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. Stockwell</span>&mdash;&lsquo;Is there any other Spirit present
who was lost at sea?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span>&mdash;&lsquo;An acquaintance of mine?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will he tell in what steamer he was lost?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correctly answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I write a list of names, will he indicate his?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. S. wrote a list of names; but neither of them was
indicated by the Spirit, though he went through the list
twice. A moment or two after, an earnest response was
heard. Mr. S. had spelt the name wrong in the first instance;
but instantly, on correcting it, the affirmative came.
The last-mentioned facts were then stated to the company,
no hint having been given in the course of the proceeding
whether it was satisfactory or not. The name indicated
was that of Samuel Stacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another friend of Mr. S. announced his presence.
His name was correctly given; and a list of towns was
written, with the request that he would point out where
he died. No response came; but on changing the word
Cambridge in the list, to Cambridge<em>port</em>, the sounds were
promptly returned. In these last two instances was an accuracy
of intelligence beyond what was looked for by the
experimenter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will the Spirit tell his birth-place?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A list of towns being written by Mr. S., was passed to
Mr. Brown, with the request that the response might be
given to him, Mr. B. being totally ignorant of the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Various tests of this nature were tried. The questions
were asked by those ignorant of their answers, and the result
was, without exception, correct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question of a separate intelligence having had due
consideration, experiments were tried with regard to the
sounds. The mediums, by request, moved to various portions
of the room; and the sounds were produced, varying
in quality according to the different substances from which
they apparently proceeded. The &lsquo;toe-joint&rsquo; theory being
suggested by some one, the mediums were requested to
stand on the spring cushion of a sofa. This they did, and
merely touching the tip of a finger against the plastering,
the sounds were distinctly and abundantly heard on, or
rather <em>in</em> the wall. They were equally distinct to a person
in the adjoining room. That the ladies had no other contact
with the wall than to touch it lightly with the tip of
a single finger, all present can testify.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nor was this action of the members of the Press the
only investigation by high authority which we two (Katie
and I) underwent on this occasion of our visit to Boston,
in 1857.</p>

<p>It was proposed by our friends that we should meet a
party of Unitarian clergymen at the house of Rev. Dr.
Harrington, in Summerville, about six miles from Boston.</p>

<p>They made a most thorough investigation. They held
a consultation in a private room, and considered that now
was the time to satisfy themselves in regard to the production
of the sounds; as they had read the statement
made by the Buffalo doctors, in which &ldquo;knee-knocking&rdquo;
figures, and also the Burr toe-ological humbug, and many
more wise theories, which they wished to prove true or
silence forever.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Francis, a brother of Lydia Maria Child, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
another distinguished clergyman, were appointed to hold
our knees, and two ladies held our feet, rested on chairs,
exposed plainly to view.</p>

<p>During the time we were held in this position, sounds
were made all around the room&mdash;on chairs, on the floor,
under their feet, etc. One old gentleman shouted out,
&ldquo;Thank God, I always believed the raps were genuine,
and now I know they are.&rdquo; He then told us he was living
near Rochester when we first came before the public, and
always felt the deepest sympathy for us.</p>

<p>At the close of the investigation we were all invited to
go into the dining-room, where a sumptuous banquet had
been prepared for the party. The Spirits of earth and
heaven met and rejoiced together on this occasion; and
there were many more of the invisible ones than of those
still in the flesh. Many sweet songs were sung, and the
timely echoes from the Spirit world told us plainly that
they were not afar off. It was time for us to leave them.
Mr. Alvin Adams had taken us there in his beautiful
equipage, and he advised us of the hour. The party accompanied
us to the carriage, and with many blessings and
words of encouragement, bid us farewell.</p>

<p>There were fifteen or more Unitarian clergymen together
with many of their lady and gentlemen friends. One of
the clergymen, laying his hand on the shoulder of Dr.
Francis, exclaimed, &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is proof positive of
that which we have all been grasping after, as a shadow,
from time immemorial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On our return to the hotel at Boston, a large party of
friends had assembled in our parlor, and met us with
outstretched hands. Wm. Lloyd Garrison said, &ldquo;I know
you have been successful, or you would not come in with
such happy faces.&rdquo; The Spirits rapped in response to his
exclamation, and we spent a pleasant evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning a large party, who came from
Vermont, occasioned considerable amusement.</p>

<p>They came &ldquo;to see the mediums,&rdquo; which seemed to be
all that some of them wanted. They waited in the reception-room.
Several of them stood on the stairs. As we
came from the breakfast table and passed through the
hall, one of them called out loudly to the others, &ldquo;There!
we&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em without paying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came from the Green Mountains, with the idea
that we were something curious to be seen: and they had
concluded to spend a dollar in order to gratify their curiosity.
Edwin Forrest and several of his friends were still
at the breakfast table, and they enjoyed the joke very
much.</p>

<p>The party were not all, however, of this kind; two or
three came in and paid the admission fee. One woman
had good evidence of communication with a daughter
lately deceased.</p>

<p>We met many interesting persons at Mr. Parks&rsquo;s, among
whom were Theodore Parker, and Rev. James Freeman
Clark, who seemed very much interested, and kindly invited
us to accompany Mr. and Mrs. Parks to his home,
which invitation was accepted. We spent a pleasant day
with his honored mother and sister, his wife being absent
from home.</p>

<p>I shall ever remember the beaming, kindly face of Rev.
Theodore Parker, who fearlessly, frankly, and honestly announced
to his friends that he was a believer in Spiritualism.
Subsequently he visited me several times in company
with Rev. John Pierpont.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ROBERT DALE OWEN AND PROFESSOR FELTON,
PRESIDENT OF HARVARD COLLEGE.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt2">Masterly Letter from Mr. Owen.</p>


<p>Although not directly connected with the affair of the
Harvard Professors, yet it comes in natural sequence to
the preceding chapter for me to mention that, after the
appearance of Robert Dale Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Footfalls on the
Boundary of Another World,&rdquo; Professor Felton, who
burned with angry zeal against Spiritualism, wrote him a
letter (April 13, 1860), which was slow in reaching its
destination. Mr. Owen, having written a reply to it, requested
Felton&rsquo;s permission to publish the former with
the latter; a request which was declined on the ground
that &ldquo;the letter was hastily written, and intended only for
your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter referred to was a fair sample of the sort of
criticism which he wrote on the subject, and which he was
willing to retail out to others, and then decline to face any
fair discussion with a highly honorable opponent, at least
his equal in public and social position, who had unanswerably
answered his bitterly libellous language. It is open
to question whether Mr. Owen&rsquo;s delicacy was not excessive
in respecting the privacy of Professor Felton&rsquo;s volunteered
letter of controversial attack upon his book, and whether
he would not have been perfectly justified in publishing it,
as he asked permission to do, side by side with the masterly
reply which it elicited. This reply, which I now proceed
to publish, will suffice to show how little the Harvard dignitary,
however learned in Greek, was a match in logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
controversy for Mr. Owen, who had been a distinguished
member of Congress, and who had recently vacated the
post of U.&nbsp;S. Minister at the court of Naples.</p>

<p>The Professor stated that he had fully &ldquo;investigated the
subject both in this country and in Europe, and that the conclusion
at which he had arrived was that the alleged physical
phenomena, such as moving of tables without the
ordinary application of physical force, <em>never take place</em>
under conditions which absolutely prevent the action of
delusion or fraud.&rdquo; He is not the only man who has
claimed to have &ldquo;investigated,&rdquo; when he has visited a few
mediums with the eyes of his mind so shut and sealed with
hostile prejudice that what he calls his investigation had
been but an idle farce.</p>

<p>Then again, in the same letter, he declares, in relation
to the investigation in Boston, that &ldquo;the whole thing
failed, failed utterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I refrain from designating this as it deserves. I refer
my readers to the history of that sham investigation for
them to give it its proper designation. He knew the
statement was not true of the manifestations during the
investigation, if his own committee could be believed. The
letter says, &ldquo;If I ever have time I shall prepare a volume
on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not, however, have time before he followed the
course of Nature, and he has now found out for himself
many things not falling within the scope of his studies as
Professor of Greek, which he did not know before.</p>

<p>After this outpouring, he goes on to sanction the same
thing in Christian Revelation. He says the cases are
different. Yes, we have the absolute facts here, and that
is better than those of long ago. The fact is, Prof. Felton
never gave it one hour of fair investigation.</p>

<p>Though Prof. Felton refused permission for the publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of his letter, I am under no restraint for the
publication of Mr. Owen&rsquo;s masterly reply to it; with
which, as it has not before been published (to my knowledge),
I am glad to be able to enrich this volume.</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, November 12, 1860.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only on my recent return from Europe that I
had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the thirtieth
of April last. I have since given to its strictures the
earnest consideration to which the character and standing
of the writer and his friendly tone justly entitle them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, on a careful review, I had found cause to believe
that the tendency of my work is such as you represent, it
would be little consolation to feel that it was prompted by
those good intentions which you are candid and courteous
enough to ascribe to me. Prudence, painstaking discrimination,
severe scrutiny of evidence, especially for the novel
or the extraordinary, are, in an author, duties as imperative
as good faith and uprightness; nor should he escape reprehension
by pleading the one, if it appear that he has neglected
the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my conscience acquits me of neglecting, save by
exceptional inadvertence, reasonable precautions. That
these may, in some cases, have proved unavailing, is the
lot of human effort. So far, however, after ten months&rsquo;
probation, I have had doubts cast upon a single narrative
only, out of the seventy or eighty which my volume contains;
and it is to the credit of your sagacity that the
story thus discredited is that of the Livonian Schoolteacher,
the very one to the evidence for which you chiefly
take exception. It was part of my business in visiting
Europe to test a case, to the conflicting evidence regarding
which, about three months after the publication of &lsquo;Footfalls,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
my attention was called by a friend; and as my inquiries,
though they showed some foundation for the story,
tended to discredit its details, I did what duty required of
me; I omitted in the English edition, recently issued, and
in the tenth American edition, the story in question, adding
an explanatory note, and substituting a narrative entitled
&lsquo;The Two Sisters,&rsquo; relative to a similar phenomenon,
and of which a copy is herewith inclosed. You will find
the names of the two witnesses initialized only; but I am
authorized by these ladies to communicate to you, if you
desire to follow up the case, their names&mdash;neither unknown
nor little esteemed&mdash;and their residence, within a day&rsquo;s
easy journey of Cambridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In two of the narratives, the &lsquo;Wynyard apparition&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Gaspar,&rsquo; I have obtained and inserted in the latest
editions important additional vouchers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not, as you inform me, the &lsquo;slightest hesitation
in rejecting the entire mass of the stories.&rsquo; Forgive
me if I say, that I admire your boldness more than your
discretion. Abercrombie, in his &lsquo;Intellectual Powers,&rsquo;
vouches (&lsquo;Footfalls,&rsquo; pp. 151, 163, 181, 204) for several of
the most remarkable. John Wesley relates (p. 225), and
Dr. Adam Clarke and the poet Southey indorse (p. 238)
another; Goethe is sponsor for one (p. 197); sceptics like
Mackay (p. 255) and Macnish (p. 155) for a second and
third; Mrs. Senator Linn for a fourth (p. 455); Dr. Bushnell
for a fifth (p. 459); William Howitt and his amiable
wife for several more (pp. 170, 171, 373); Mr. and Mrs.
S.&nbsp;C. Hall for two of the most interesting (pp. 447, 463).
At least a dozen are attested by clergymen of unimpeached
character. If all these names seem to you irresponsible,
and if you refuse credit, unless men be &lsquo;put on the stand
and under the solemnity of an oath,&rsquo; that species of evidence
also, the highest known to the law, I have furnished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
The facts touching the Mompesson disturbances were officially
proved in court (p. 221); so, before the sheriff of
Edinburgh, were those which tormented Captain Molesworth
(p. 254); so, above all, were the phenomena of the
Cideville Parsonage, running through two months and a
half. In this last case I have given (pp. 275 to 282) the
sworn testimony of <em>eleven</em> witnesses taken down, as the
French forms of law require, in writing, read over to each
witness, and its accuracy attested by the signature of each.
Among these witnesses were the mayor of the town, the
Marquis de Mirville, well known as an author of repute, a
neighboring lady of rank and her son, and three clergymen.
The mayor swears that he saw the shovel and tongs
move from the fireplace into the room, no one touching
them or near them; that, having replaced them, the same
thing happened a second time, &lsquo;while the witness had his
eyes on them, so as to detect any trick.&rsquo; The Curate of
Saussy saw a &lsquo;hammer fly, impelled by an invisible force,
from the spot where it lay, and fall on the floor without
more noise than if he had placed it there.&rsquo; All testify to
phenomena, and especially to knockings, as marvellous as
any which American Spiritualism claims. Monsieur de
Saint Victor deposes that &lsquo;he felt convinced, that if every
person in the house had set to work, together, to pound
with mallets on the floor, they would not have produced
such a racket&rsquo; (p. 280). Not one of the witnesses, placed
under such solemn responsibilities, &lsquo;shrinks from repeating
the monstrous story.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cideville wonders, thus attested by evidence
strong enough to hang a dozen men, far exceed those of
Hydesville. Are you prepared to pronounce these eleven
witnesses (and as many more, whose testimony I have
omitted, and who swear to the same incidents) to be, as
you declared the Foxes, &lsquo;wretched cheats, contemptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and dishonest&rsquo;? Did they, too, palm &lsquo;unscrupulous frauds
on deluded people&rsquo;? Have you not the &lsquo;slightest hesitation&rsquo;
in setting down persons of character and station as
wilful perjurers?&mdash;nay, as motiveless perjurers? Or
were they, one and all, deluded? Were the impressions
their senses received due only to &lsquo;ill-regulated imaginations&rsquo;?
What sort of imagination is it that would persuade
two men that a table which they sought, by main
force, to prevent from moving, did move, without conceivable
cause, in spite of their efforts? (p. 280.) Do
people imagine &lsquo;such a clatter in the room that one can
hardly endure it&rsquo;?&mdash;or that &lsquo;every piece of furniture
there was set in vibration&rsquo;?&mdash;or such a pounding that the
witness &lsquo;expected every moment that the floor of the
apartment would sink beneath his feet&rsquo;? (p. 280.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take me to task for narrating on insufficient testimony.
If the rules of evidence which I have applied in
the Mompesson case, in the Wesley case, in the Cideville
case, and I will add in that of the Rochester Knockings,
are to be rejected as untrustworthy, then not only shall we
sink back to scepticism in all history and (as far as historical
evidence goes) in all religion, but proof will fail us, in
all our courts of justice, alike to acquit the innocent and
condemn the guilty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not allege that all the narratives in my book are
equally well authenticated. The Stilling story, for example
(p. 317), may be taken as apocryphal. That of the
&lsquo;Surgeon&rsquo;s Assistant&rsquo; (p. 325) has not been verified by me.
&lsquo;The Rescue&rsquo; (p. 333) came to me, thirty years after it
happened, at second hand. But in these and in all similar
examples throughout the book, where the nature of the
case did not admit of evidence at first hand, I have specially
called the attention of the reader to that fact. Nor,
if one or more of these stories should prove to be without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
foundation, would it be just, for that cause, to discredit
the others. The &lsquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex uno disce omnes</i>&rsquo; argument is not
applicable here. Each narrative ought to be judged independently,
by its own evidence. It is a sound maxim in
law, that the superfluous does not invalidate the essential.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may add that, if in one example I have negligently
omitted corroborative inquiries, I am not in the habit of
sparing pains to authenticate a narrative. You imagine
that I have been satisfied with the reports in Spiritual
papers about the &lsquo;Electric girl.&rsquo; I spent a week in Paris
in procuring the original documents in that case and embodying
them in my narrative. A small portion only of
these is contained in the &lsquo;Comptes Rendus.&rsquo; The authentic
details have never yet been given to the American
public. They are of great interest in a scientific point of
view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You assume that such men as Arago regard clairvoyance
as mere trickery. Arago, in 1853, expressly said
(&lsquo;Footfalls,&rsquo; p.&nbsp;23) that &lsquo;somnambulism ought not to be
rejected <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, especially by those who have kept up
with the progress of modern science;&rsquo; and he admitted
(&lsquo;Footfalls,&rsquo; p.&nbsp;68) that &lsquo;psychology may one day obtain a
place among the exact sciences.&rsquo; Cuvier went further.
He conceded (&lsquo;Footfalls,&rsquo; p.&nbsp;68) the principle lying at the
base of Mesmerism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as my book treats only of spontaneous phenomena,
not of those that are evoked, I have therein said
nothing of the Foxes, except in connection with the narrative
of what, in the olden time, would have been called
the &lsquo;haunted house&rsquo; of Hydesville; one of a class of
which I have given numerous other older examples. Now,
however, having been afforded by the sisters ample opportunity
to investigate the rappings and other manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
alleged to occur in their presence, I am ready, after warning,
to go farther, and to say that, whatever the true character
of these phenomena, I see no reason whatever for
ascribing them to imposture. Nothing came to light in
the course of this investigation other than what bore, to
my mind, the impress of an honest desire to be freed, by
rigid tests of fair dealing, from all blame. I never rest
my opinion of character or motive upon report when I can
have opportunity of personal verification. Such opportunity,
which in this case I believe you have not had, I am
enabled now to offer you. I am authorized by Mrs. Underhill
(formerly Leah Fox) and by her husband (a gentleman
of New York who has been, for seventeen years,
secretary of one of the principal insurance offices in Wall
Street), to say that, though Mrs. Underhill has not for
some years sat as a professional medium, and has resolved
not again to do so, she is willing, in the interests of truth,
to afford you, during the university vacation, or at other
time when your leisure serves, all reasonable facilities for
strict investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray it may not be understood that I urge you to
accept this offer. I think, indeed, that such an investigation
is not unworthy either of your character or of mine.
But I am no propagandist; and I have observed that if
there be nothing within which moves us to undertake such
inquiries, they seldom afford satisfaction or eventuate in
useful results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak of my book as &lsquo;ill-judged and mischievous,&rsquo;
as &lsquo;furnishing aid to hosts of deceivers,&rsquo; and you think it,
&lsquo;in the present state of intellectual and moral disorder&rsquo;
on the subjects of which it treats, &lsquo;peculiarly dangerous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truth, unless prematurely urged (John xvi. 12), is
never ill-judged or mischievous. I did not go in search of
this subject. It came up in the course of human events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and doubtless at the proper time and for a good purpose. I
found it already controlling the belief of hundreds of thousands,
engaging the attention of millions. This, if it presented
no other claims, appeared to me to entitle it, before
judgment pronounced, to diligent and respectful inquiry.
Thus inquiring, I perceived, as you have done, &lsquo;intellectual
and moral disorders&rsquo; not unfrequently following in the
train of its influence; yet, looking at it more closely, I became
convinced that it produced good as well as evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surveying the ground further, I found the arena occupied
chiefly by partisans; some of these (shall I include
yourself?) delving the good; others, in their hasty enthusiasm,
overlooking the evil. The former seemed to me to
forget that it is not by despising error that we correct it;
the latter, that the new and the untried often run into
error and extravagance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Desiring, after twenty years of public life, some more
tranquil and philosophical field of labor, I discovered none
which appeared to promise more useful results than this.
If, as you allege, &lsquo;all the phenomena are due to two, and
only two sources&mdash;delusion and imposture,&rsquo; these should
be detected and exploded, as by carefully prosecuted researches
every delusion and every imposture can be. If,
as I believe, there be a foundation of truth underlying
them, still there is imperative demand for the exercise of
prudence and the precautions of due regulation. Lacking
these, a source of good may eventuate in evil. Even if
the phenomena, wisely followed up, may elevate morality
and fortify religion, yet if these marvels are permitted to
spread among us without chart or compass whereby to
steer our course through an unexplored ocean of mystery,
we may find ourselves at the mercy of very sinister influences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the general question at issue between yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and me, you admit the reality of Spiritual influences directly
exerted by God upon human intelligence. So far
as, from the Creator&rsquo;s work, we may judge His modes of
action, these are mediate and by ministering agencies, not
by direct intervention. &ldquo;Why, then, should we regard the
hypothesis of Spiritual interposition (Hebrews i.&nbsp;14) as a
baseless superstition?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You further admit the occurrence, though only in
Christ&rsquo;s day, of Spiritual intercourse. But a dispassionate
survey of the economy of the universe tends to the conviction
that no great law of action ever shows itself, for a
brief season, thereafter to disappear forever. And Scripture,
instead of thus restricting Spiritual phenomena, intimates
(Mark xvi. 17, 18) their continuance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guided by such general views, I published &lsquo;Footfalls.&rsquo;
Its prompt sale and its favorable reception have been my
least rewards. Tokens of sympathy and of gratitude contain
the greater. A mother, deprived by death of her
favorite child, and refusing to be comforted because he
was not, confesses that she has been indebted to its pages
for healthy and hopeful views of death, renovated spirits,
courage to labor and to wait. A sceptic into whose hands
the volume fell a few weeks before his decease, requests
that, after he is gone, I may be informed that to that volume,
and especially to its chapter on the &lsquo;Change at Death,&rsquo;
he owed the revolution of a life&rsquo;s opinions, and the first
consolatory conviction which had ever reached him that
there was a fairer and a better world toward which he was
fast hastening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By their fruits ye shall know them,&rsquo; said the great
Author of our religion. Do not fruits like these indicate
a good tree? And if the chief narratives contained in
my book may be trusted, what are their teachings? That
not an effort to store our minds or school our hearts, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
here in time, but has its result and its reward hereafter in
eternity. But what motive to exertion in good can be
proposed to man more powerful than such an assurance?</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are my reasons for still believing, notwithstanding
your opinion of my work, that it is of wholesome tendency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time, the great teacher, will decide between us. Ten
years&mdash;probably less&mdash;will see the question determined
whether the Spiritual hypothesis is destined to grow in
favor and assume station as a reality, or to sink into discredit,
as a mere figment of the brain. I am content to
bide the event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, following my convictions of the useful, I
propose next year (unless ere then I pass to another phase
of existence where much that is now obscure will doubtless
be made plain) to follow up my first work by another;
and therein I purpose to examine what I have not yet
touched upon; namely, the progress and character of what
go by the name of &lsquo;Spiritual manifestations.&rsquo; I purpose
to investigate first their verity, then their influence; to inquire
under what aspects they have proved injurious, and
under what beneficial to mankind; how far they may be
usefully prosecuted, and at what point they become prejudicial
or unsafe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This second volume, like the first, shall contain many
materials, some suggestions, few opinions. On such a subject
as this, dogmatism, whether in affirming or denying,
is unpardonable. There is, perhaps, no human inquiry, as
to which Bacon&rsquo;s wise aphorism is more applicable: &lsquo;If a
man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts;
but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end
in certainties.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If even the opinions and suggestions I may offer should
fail in accuracy, the materials will remain valuable, if care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and industry may avail judiciously to select them. From
these each reader can deduce his own conclusions; and
thus, perhaps, such incidental puzzles as the seeming investment
with clothing of apparitions may be relieved
from the imputation of absurdity, if they do not find full
solution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word, in conclusion, as to the alleged abandonment
of what is called Spiritualism by certain persons named by
you. You adduce the reported defection of such seceders
as conclusive argument against the cause they desert. But
it proves nothing, except, perhaps, that one extreme often
results in its opposite. If these men, forsaking common
sense, ran off into wild extravagance, little wonder that
they repented. And if their case be otherwise, their secession,
if secede they did, has still no weight. Weak men
adopt opinions, and again discard them, alike on insufficient
evidence. We sometimes turn back, confused, in the very
path of progress. Du Fay, the discoverer of the fact that
there are two kinds or states of electricity, repudiated his
own brilliant discovery.</p>

<p>I may add that Mr. Owen, in the summer of 1859, while
residing with us, engaged upon his first book (the &ldquo;Footfalls&rdquo;),
obtained the willing consent of Mr. Underhill and
myself, to invite Prof. Felton to come and accept the hospitality
of our home at 232 W. 37th Street, for a fortnight
or as much shorter or longer a period as he might favor us
with his stay; as a means of receiving daily and hourly
evidences of all he should like to investigate. Prof. Felton
declined the invitation. The invitation proved at least our
willingness to submit to such an exhaustive investigation.
What disposition its non-acceptance indicated on the other
side, in regard to a question which is confessedly one of
supremest vital importance to all mankind, it is not for me
to say, but rather to leave to the judgment of those who
may do me the honor of being my readers.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> To this letter Prof. Felton never made any published reply. A letter
from him, bearing date seven days after that of Mr. Owen, is before me
(or rather a copy of it which Mr. Owen allowed Mr. Underhill to make);
but, while perfectly civil and friendly, it bears on its face the evidence
of a virtual prohibition of publication, saying that it was so hastily
written that it was despatched without reperusal, and that his other
duties left him no time for public controversy on this subject. I need
only say that it was mainly made up of slashing and sweeping generalities
against Spiritualism, which Mr. Owen would have had not the
slightest difficulty in confuting&mdash;and in confuting so triumphantly that
the learned Greek professor of Harvard would not have had a rag left
to cover the nakedness of the &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">absurdum</i>&rdquo; to which he would have been
reduced by Owen&rsquo;s superior brain and pen. A further appeal against publication
was clearly involved in a remark that he contemplated some
future publication of a volume on the subject. Mr. Owen therefore
could do no more than await the promised volume, but the purpose was
never carried into effect; which is much to be regretted, since its non-appearance
costs to the literature of Spiritualism a third volume (this
time controversial), which would have constituted a precious sequel to
Mr. Owen&rsquo;s two great works, the &ldquo;Footfalls on the Boundary of another
World,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Debatable Land.&rdquo; The two gentlemen (both of
whom I knew) have now passed beyond that Boundary, and beyond all
further Debate about that Land, where we shall all soon find them, I
doubt not, now excellent friends to the cause of Spiritualism, as well
as to each other.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

THE MEDIUMSHIP OF THE AUTHOR.</span></h2>

Water, and in the Living Wood&mdash;Seeing the Raps&mdash;Moving
Ponderable Bodies by Occult Agency&mdash;Crucial Test&mdash;A
Heavy Dinner-table Suspended in the Air by Occult
Agency.</p>


<p>I will here introduce some interesting extracts from Robert
Dale Owen, relating to some of his personal experiences
with me, which will speak for themselves:</p>


<h3 class="f10">I.</h3>

<p class="center f8">MOVING A LEDGE OF ROCK ON THE SEA-SHORE.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the twenty-fourth of August, 1861, I accepted an invitation,
from Mr. Samuel B. Underhill, of New Rochelle,
a sea-side village on the shore of Long Island Sound, to
spend the next day with him, in company with Mr. and
Mrs. Underhill (their near relatives).</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the afternoon of August 25, Mr. S.&nbsp;B. Underhill
drove us out in his carriage, through the picturesque country
adjoining the village; the party consisting of Mr. S.&nbsp;B.
Underhill and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. D. Underhill, and
myself.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<p>&ldquo;In the course of the drive, coming near the shore of the
Sound, at a point where there were long ledges of rock
slanting down into the water, it suddenly suggested itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to me that here was an excellent opportunity for a crucial
test. I inquired of Mrs. Underhill if she had ever tried to
obtain raps on the sea-shore. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said; she never had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you think we can get them here?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;I
have never found any place where they could not be had,&rsquo;
she replied; &lsquo;so I dare say we can.&rsquo; Thereupon there
were three raps&mdash;the conventional sign of assent&mdash;from
the bottom of the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we drove down to the beach, and got out to test the
matter. The portion of rock whither we repaired was not
an isolated block, detached from the rest, but part of a
large, flat mass of rock, covering at least half an acre, and
running back into a bluff bank that rose beyond it; there
were also several underlying ledges. We were about
thirty feet from the sea and, as there was a moderate
breeze, the surf broke on the rocks below us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yet, standing on the ledge beside Mrs. Underhill,
and asking for the raps, I heard them quite distinctly above
the noise produced by the surf. This was several times
repeated, with the same result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Mrs. Underhill and Mrs. S.&nbsp;B. Underhill sat
down, and I, stepping on a lower ledge, laid my ear on the
ledge on which the ladies were sitting and repeated my request.
In a few seconds the raps were heard by me from
within the substance of the rock and immediately beneath
my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then sought to verify the matter by the sense of
touch. Placing my hand on the same ledge, a few feet
from Mrs. Underhill, and asking for the raps, when these
came audibly, I felt, simultaneously with each rap, a slight
but <em>unmistakably distinct vibration or concussion of the
rock</em>. It was sufficiently marked to indicate to me a rap,
once or twice, when a louder roll of the surf for a moment
drowned the sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Without making any remark as to what I felt, I asked
Mr. U. to put his hand on the ledge. &lsquo;Why!&rsquo; he suddenly
exclaimed, &lsquo;the whole rock vibrates!&rsquo; During all this
time Mrs. Underhill sat, as far as I could judge, in complete
repose.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo; p.&nbsp;346.</p>


<h3 class="f10">II.</h3>

<p class="center f8">RAPS ON THE WATER AND IN THE LIVING WOOD.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the tenth of July, 1861, I joined a few friends in
an excursion from the city of New York, by steamboat, to
the Highlands of Neversink; Mr. and Mrs. Underhill being
of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me, while sitting on deck by Mrs. Underhill,
to ask if we could have the raps there. Instantly
they were distinctly heard, first from the deck, and then I
heard them, and quite plainly <em>felt them</em>, on the wooden
stool on which I sat. In the afternoon our party went out
in a sailing boat, fifteen or twenty feet long. There, again
at my suggestion, we had them, sounding from under the
floor of the boat. It had a centre-board, or sliding keel,
and we had raps from within the long, narrow box that
inclosed it. At any part of this box where we called for
the raps, we obtained them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the evening we ascended a hill, back of the hotel,
to the Highland light-house. In returning and passing
through a wood on the hill-side, I proposed to try if we
could have raps from the ground; and immediately I
plainly heard them from beneath the ground on which we
trod: it was a dull sound, as of blows struck on the earth.
Then I asked Mrs. Underhill to touch one of the trees with
the tips of her fingers, and, applying my ear to the tree, I
beard the raps from beneath the bark. Other persons of
our party verified this as I had done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In returning, next morning, on another steamer, we
had raps on the hand-rail of the upper promenade deck,
and also from within a small metal boat that was turned
upside down, on the deck below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notes of these experiments were taken immediately
on my return to New York.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo;
p. 345.</p>


<h3 class="f10">III.</h3>

<p class="center f8">SEEING THE RAPS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was during an evening session at Mr. Underhill&rsquo;s,
February 22, 1860. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Underhill,
Kate Fox, and myself, there were present Mr. Underhill&rsquo;s
aged father and mother; venerable examples of the plain,
primitive Quakers, both of whom took the deepest interest
in the proceedings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By request, through the raps, the gas was extinguished
and we joined hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon lights were seen floating about the room,
apparently phosphorescent. At first they were small, just
visible, but gradually they became larger, attaining the size
and general outline of hands; but I could not distinguish
any fingers. These lights usually showed themselves first
behind and between Leah and Kate, near the floor. Then
they rose; sometimes remaining near Leah&rsquo;s head, sometimes
near her sister&rsquo;s. One of them was nearly as large
as a human head. None of these touched me, though one
approached within a few inches. Another made circles in
the air just above our heads. After floating about for a
brief space, they usually seemed to return either to Leah
or Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the hands of the circle remained joined, I looked
under the table<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and saw lights, as many as ten or twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
times, on or near the floor, and moving about. Once, while
I was looking intently at such a light, about as large as a
small fist, it rose and fell, as a hammer would with which
one was striking against the floor. At each stroke a loud
rap was heard in connection. It was exactly as if <em>an invisible
hand held an illuminated hammer and pounded
with it</em>. Then, desiring conscious proof of what I saw
was not by human agency, I asked <em>mentally</em>, &lsquo;Will the
Spirit strike with that light three times?&rsquo; which was done
forthwith; and then, after an interval, repeated.</p>


<p>&ldquo;When, a second time, the light was seen and I was
noticing the corresponding sounds, some one said, &lsquo;Can
you make it softer?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost instantly I saw the light diminish and strike
the floor, at intervals, with a soft and muffled sound, just
distinguishable.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo; p.&nbsp;348.</p>


<h3 class="f10">IV.</h3>

<p class="center f8">MOVING PONDERABLE BODIES BY OCCULT AGENCY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. But
as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water;
and he cried, and said (to Elisha), &lsquo;Alas, master!&rsquo; for it
was borrowed. And the man of God said, &lsquo;Where fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
it?&rsquo; And he showed him the place. And he cut down
a stick, and cast it thither; and the iron did swim.&rsquo; (2
Kings vi. 4-6.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The raising from the ground of weighty substances, or
the moving of these from place to place, is one of the most
common, and most easily verified, of physical manifestations.
I have elsewhere given many examples of it. (See
&lsquo;Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World.&rsquo;) Here I
shall add but two or three out of the numerous cases that
have come under my eye during Spiritual sessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most satisfactory test of the power, by occult agency,
to raise ponderous substances was suggested to me by that
practical thinker, the late Robert Chambers, the well-known
author and publisher, during his visit to the United
States, in the autumn of 1860; and we carried it out on
the thirteenth of October of that year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the evening of that day we had a sitting in Mrs.
Underhill&rsquo;s dining-room; there being present Mr. and
Mrs. Underhill, Kate Fox, Mr. Chambers, and myself.
In this room we found an extension dinner-table of solid
mahogany, capable of seating fourteen persons. This we
contracted to the form of a centre-table, and, having procured
a large steelyard, we found that it weighed in that
form a hundred and twenty-one pounds. We suspended
this table by the steelyard, in exact equipoise and about
eight inches from the floor. Then we sat down by it;
and while our experiment proceeded, Mrs. Underhill sat
with the points of both feet touching one of mine and
Kate in the same relation to Mr. Chambers. This was
done at their suggestion, so as to afford us proof that they
had no physical agency in the matter. Their hands were
over the table, near the top, but not touching it. There
was bright gas-light. Thus we were able to obtain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<h4>CRUCIAL TEST,</h4>

<p>the table remaining suspended, with the constant weight
at the figure of 121. We asked that it might be made
lighter. In a few seconds the long arm ascended. We
moved the weight to the figure 100: it still ascended;
then to 80; then to 60. Even at this last figure the
smaller arm of the steelyard was somewhat depressed,
showing that the table, for the moment, weighed less than
sixty pounds. It had <em>lost more than half its weight</em>,
namely, upward of sixty-one pounds. In other words
there was a power equal to sixty-one pounds sustaining it.
Then we asked that it might be made heavier; and it was
so; first, as the figures indicated, to 130, and finally to a
hundred and forty-four pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The change of weight continued, in each instance, from
three to eight seconds, as we ascertained by our watches;
and during the whole time the ladies maintained the same
position of feet and hands; Mr. Underhill not approaching
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had given Mr. Underhill no notice of our intention
to ask for this experiment. The heavy steelyard was
bought for the occasion from a hardware-store in the
neighborhood. How much a Jewish axe-head commonly
weighed, in the days of Elisha, I know not; it could be
but a few pounds. Our miracle (dynamics) exceeded that
of the prophet, as far as regards the weight of the body
that was made lighter. But the Hebrew seer was at a
greater distance from the object raised than were our
mediums. On the evening just preceding that on which
we tried the above experiment I had a sitting at Mr. Underhill&rsquo;s,
with very satisfactory result.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<h4>A HEAVY DINNER-TABLE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR WITHOUT
CONTACT.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Our session was on the evening of October 12, 1860,
lasting from half-past nine till eleven.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was held in the
same room and at the same table before mentioned, and
by gas-light. Present, Mr. and Mrs. Underhill, Kate Fox,
Mr. Harrison Gray Dyer, of New York, and myself. We
had very loud rappings, from various parts of the room
and on the chairs. Then, while our hands were on the
table, it began to move, sometimes with a rotary motion,
sometimes rising up on one side, until finally it rose from
the floor all but one leg. Then we sought to induce it to
rise entirely from the floor. After (what seemed) strenuous
efforts, almost successful, to rise, we aided it by each
putting a single finger under it; and, with this slight assistance,
it rose into the air and remained suspended during
six or seven seconds.</p>


<p>&ldquo;After a time we asked whether, if we removed our fingers
from the table-top, while it was in the air, it could
still remain suspended; and the reply (by rapping) being
in the affirmative, after aiding it to rise as before, we withdrew
our fingers entirely, raising them above it. The
table then remained, nearly level, suspended without any
human support whatever, during the space of five or six
seconds; and then gradually settled down, without jar or
sudden dropping, to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, anxious to advance a step further, we asked if the
table could not be raised from the floor without any aid
or contact whatever. The reply being in the affirmative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
we stood up and placed all our hands over it, at the distance
of three or four inches from the table-top: when it
rose of itself, following our hands as we gradually raised
them, till it hung in the air about the same distance from
the floor as before. There it remained six or seven seconds,
preserving its horizontal, and almost as steady as
when it rested on the ground; then it slowly descended,
still preserving the horizontal, until the feet reached the
carpet. As before, there was no jar or sudden dropping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same experiment was repeated next evening in the
presence of Robert Chambers, after we had completed our
tests with the steelyard; and with exactly the same results.
At first, as before, we raised it on our fingers;
then, withdrawing them, it remained in the air six or seven
seconds. On the second trial it rose entirely without contact,
remaining suspended for about the same space. It
should here be remarked that we were in the habit, during
these experiments, of moving the table to different parts
of the room, and of looking under it from time to time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon the whole I consider this moving of physical objects
to be as conclusively established, in its ultramundane
aspect, as the Spirit rap. A hundred and twenty pound
dinner-table is no trifle to lift. The conditions exclude
the possibility of concealed machinery. And by what
conceivable bodily effort, undetectable by watchful bystanders,
can two or three assistants heave from the
ground, maintain in the air, and then drop slowly to the
floor, so ponderous a weight, with their hands the while
in full view, under broad gas-light? No one in his senses,
and believing in his senses, can witness what I have witnessed,
and yet remain a sceptic in this matter.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Debatable
Land,&rdquo; p.&nbsp;361.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Mrs. S.&nbsp;B. Underhill was a sister of my husband, and a full believer
in Spiritualism. There was no relationship between Mr. S.&nbsp;B. and Mr.
D. Underhill. It had simply happened that his sister had married a
gentleman of her own name with whom she had no tie of kin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This is literally exact that Mr. Owen &ldquo;looked under the table,&rdquo; but
it omits to say <em>how</em>; and I the more readily supply that omission, because
he himself, after his book was published, expressed regret that,
in his cultivation of brevity, he had not explained himself more fully.
To speak of having looked under a table rather suggests the idea of
having stooped down for that purpose. The following was exactly the
way in which it passed. Mr. Owen desired to look under it and thought
of so doing, when the table, which was <em>an extension-table</em>, opened itself,
its two halves being drawn apart, so as to enable him to see through as
well as under it, through the wide opening thus made&mdash;evidently by
the Spirits who had seen his thought. As this was a distinct phenomenal
fact (and one not without its interest) Mr. Owen regretted afterward that
he had not stated it precisely as it had occurred.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> We found, by repeated trials, that our experiments succeeded
better when we sat at a late hour, after the servants had gone to bed,
when the house and the streets were quiet.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">EXPERIENCES OF THE AUTHOR WITH ROBERT DALE
OWEN (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>


<h3 class="f10">V.</h3>

<p class="center f8">AN EVENTFUL HOUR WITH LEAH FOX UNDERHILL&mdash;A GHOST
SPEAKS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on the evening of Sunday, the twenty-first of October,
1860. The sitting was held in Mr. Underhill&rsquo;s
dining-room, lasting from ten till eleven o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The room was lighted by gas. There were two windows
fronting the street; three doors: one opening on a
corridor whence a staircase ascended to the next floor, another
opening on a short passage leading to the kitchen,
the third, the door of a pantry in which were crockery and
various other articles, including a barrel of loaf-sugar
in one corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we had any demonstrations the raps requested
us to wait until the domestics had retired. There were
two servant girls in the kitchen, whom Mrs. Underhill
sent up stairs to bed, so that everything was profoundly
still on that floor of the house. Then we fastened the inside
blinds of both windows, so as to exclude all light from
the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before commencing the session, at Mr. Underhill&rsquo;s request,
I shut and locked the three doors above referred to,
leaving the keys in the doors, so that no one, even if furnished
with keys, could open them from without. I satisfied
myself by careful personal inspection of the furniture,
and otherwise, that there was no one in the pantry, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
any one in the dining-room except the three persons who,
along with myself, assisted at the sitting. These persons
were Mr. Daniel Underhill, Mrs. Underhill (Leah Fox),
and her nephew, Charles, twelve years old. We sat down
to a centre-table, three feet eleven inches in diameter, of
black walnut, and without table-cover. (I had previously
looked under it; nothing to be seen there.) The gas-burner
was immediately over it. I sat on the east side of
the table, Mr. Underhill opposite to me, Mrs. Underhill
on my left hand, and Charles on the right. There was no
fire in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rappings commenced, gradually increasing in number
and force. After a short interval they spelled, &lsquo;Put
out the gas.&rsquo; It was accordingly extinguished and the
room remained in total darkness. Then &lsquo;Join hands.&rsquo;
Shortly after doing so I felt, several times, a cool breeze
blowing on my cheek. Then was spelled, &lsquo;Do not break
the circle.&rsquo; We obeyed; and, except for a second or two
at a time, it remained, on my part, unbroken throughout
the rest of the sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a few minutes I perceived a light, apparently of a
phosphorescent character, on my left, near the floor. It
was, at first, of a rectangular form, with the edges rounded.
I judged it to be about four inches long and two and a
half inches wide. It seemed like an open palm illuminated,
but the light which emanated from it showed quite
distinctly its entire surface; I could distinguish no fingers.
For a time it moved about near the floor, then it rose into
the air and floated about the room, sometimes over our
heads. After a time it changed its appearance and increased
in brightness. It then resembled an opaque oval
substance, about the size of a child&rsquo;s head, muffled up in
the folds of some very white and shining material, like
fine linen, only brighter. As it moved about, I began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
hear, at first imperfectly, afterward somewhat more distinctly,
the rustling as of a silk dress, or of other light
article of female apparel, giving the impression that one
or more persons were moving silently about the room.
Then the light passed behind Mrs. Underhill; then I saw
it close to Mr. Underhill, and just opposite to me. Mr.
Underhill said, &lsquo;Can you not go down to Mr. Owen? do
try.&rsquo; Thereupon it moved slowly around to my left side.
This time the folds appeared to have dropped, and what
seemed a face (still covered, however, with a luminous
veil) came bending down within five or six inches of my
own face, as I turned toward it. As it approached, I
plainly distinguished the semi-luminous outline of an entire
figure of the usual female stature. I saw, very distinctly,
the arms moving. At the lower extremity of its
right arm, as if on the palm of the hand, the figure
bore what seemed a rectangular substance, about four
inches by two, as nearly as I could estimate. This substance
was more brightly illuminated than the rest of the
figure. It may have been only the illuminated palm, but
I do not think it was; it seemed more like a transparent
box with phosphorescent light within it. Whatever it
was, the figure raised it above its head, and then passed it
slowly down close to what seemed the face, and then over
the upper part of the body, as one might pass a lantern
over any object, with intent to make it visible. This action
it repeated several times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By aid of the illuminations thus afforded I saw, more
distinctly than before, the general form of the face and
figure; but both appeared covered with a half-transparent
veil, and I could distinguish no features; nor were the outlines
of the body, nor of the limbs, sharply defined. The
motion of the right arm with the light was the most
marked and frequent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;While this was taking place I held Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s hand
and Charles&rsquo;s. As the various phases of the phenomena
succeeded each other, I remarked on what I saw; and Mr.
Underhill, from the opposite side of the table, responded
to my remarks; so that I am quite certain he was seated
there. I expressed a wish that the Spirit would touch me,
and Mr. Underhill said, from his place, &lsquo;We are very
anxious that the Spirit should touch Mr. Owen, if it can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thereupon I felt what seemed a human hand laid on my
head. And, as I looked steadily at the figure, which stood
on my left side, I saw its head bend toward my left shoulder.
A moment afterward I <em>felt</em>, and simultaneously <em>heard</em>,
just behind the point of that shoulder, a kiss imprinted.
I could not, for any physical fact, obtain the evidence of
three senses&mdash;sight, touch, and hearing&mdash;more distinctly
than in this case I did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately afterward I saw this luminous body pass
behind me; what seemed, by the touch, to be hands gently
laid hold of both my shoulders and turned me round to
the right. I looked on that side and the figure now stood
by my right shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After pausing there for a few seconds, it moved toward
the window furthest from me, and we heard the sounds
as if some one were attempting to open the window-blind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Underhill, from his place, remarked that it would
probably be able to effect this; for it had done so on a
previous occasion. The blind was in four compartments,
each of which could be opened or closed by raising or lowering
a wire attached to movable slats. The figure opened
the upper left-hand quarter of the blind, so that a faint
light shone in from the street lamps. I was looking at the
window when this occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to this time the appearance, gradually becoming
more luminous, had been in sight, moving about the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
fully five minutes. There was not the slightest footfall
when it moved. My hearing is very acute; I listened for
every sound; and as, in the intervals of conversation, the
silence was unbroken, I could have detected the fall of the
lightest footstep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this time the light which illuminated the figure
gradually faded, and soon I could no longer distinguish
any form. The slight rustling sound, unaccompanied by
footsteps, still, however, continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly we heard a noise as of the door opposite to me
being unlocked; then of its being hastily opened and shut;
then the rustling sound approached me on the left, and a
key was laid on my left hand. Then a second door was
heard to be unlocked in the same way, and I heard another
key laid on the table just before me. Then a third door
(that of the cup-board, by the sound) was heard to be unlocked
and opened, and a key, as if pitched over our heads,
was heard to drop with a clatter on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While this was going on I commented, from time to
time, on each occurrence, and received answers from Mr.
Underhill, from his place at the table opposite to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we were conversing, there was a rattling of the
crockery in the cup-board. Mrs. Underhill expressed her
apprehensions as to some favorite china, but Mr. Underhill
replied, &lsquo;I will trust the Spirits;&rsquo; and then added,
&lsquo;Cannot the Spirit bring something to Mr. Owen?&rsquo; Almost
immediately there was set down on the table, close to
my left hand, some object which I touched, and it proved
to be a cut-glass goblet. In setting it down, what seemed
a human hand touched mine, and immediately afterward
was laid several times on my shoulder. I expressed
a desire that it would distinctly grasp my hand, to which
Mr. Underhill responded. Instantly a small hand, or what
in touch resembled one, took hold of my hand and grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
it. Then it clasped my bare wrist, gently but with a firm
grasp; then my lower arm, then my upper arm; each time
with a distinct grasp. I could not have distinguished the
touch from that of a human hand. It was a little cooler
than mine, but not disagreeably so. There was nothing
chilly or clammy or otherwise unpleasant about it. There
was after this, throughout the sitting, no sound whatever
of opening or closing doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it was touching me thus, Mr. Underhill said,
&lsquo;Can you fill the goblet you brought to Mr. Owen with
water?&rsquo; There was a rustling but no footstep, a slight
noise in the pantry, and then the sound of something
dropped into the goblet; but, putting my hand in, I felt
no water. In doing so I broke the circle only for a moment.
Then, just behind me, I heard a sound as if the glass of
the clock on the mantel-piece were touched and shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this time there was no word spoken except by those
at the table; but, once or twice, there was a whistling
sound in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When, soon after, we were bidden by the raps to relight
the gas, I found three door-keys on the table, the goblet
also, and within it a lump of loaf-sugar. Both the room
doors were closed, but on trying them I found that neither
was locked. Two of the keys on the table fitted them.
The door of the pantry, which the third key fitted, stood
open, and the cover of the barrel of sugar was pushed
partly off. The left-hand upper portion of the blind, at
which we had seen and heard the figure, was open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are facts, all briefly noted down the same evening
on which they happened, and written out in full the
next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The allegations, by the raps, were that the Spirit
present was that of a daughter of Mrs. Fox, who had died
young, and that other Spirits were present (among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
an Indian Spirit), aiding her to show herself to our circle.
Emily&mdash;that was the girl&rsquo;s name&mdash;had been Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s
favorite sister, long mourned over, and had lain,
during the last hour of her life and at the moment of death,
in Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s arms. Mr. Underhill stated to me
that he had seen the same Spirit, as distinctly, several
times before; and that he had been able to distinguish the
features. He appeared also, on this occasion, to have perceived
the whole figure, and especially the features, more
distinctly than I did, though my natural sight has always
been keen, and, except within ordinary reading distance,
is still nearly as strong as it was thirty years ago. With
these exceptions, all present, so far as I could judge by
comparing notes with them during and after the sitting,
seemed to have seen and heard the succession of phenomena
here described just as I myself had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to this time, never having witnessed any such
phenomena as these, I had often doubted within myself
how I should be affected by witnessing an apparition, or
what I had reason to consider such.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>seemed</em> to me that I should experience no alarm;
but of this in advance of actual experience, I could not be
assured. Now I know just how far I can trust my self-possession.
Awe I undoubtedly felt&mdash;awe and intense
interest; but, in looking back on my feelings throughout
that wonder-bringing hour, I feel certain that a physician
might have placed his finger on my wrist, even at the moment
when that dimly illuminated Presence first bent over
me, with scarcely six inches intervening between its veiled
face and mine&mdash;its hands placed on my head, its lips touching
my shoulder&mdash;and not have found the beatings of my
pulse unduly accelerated; or if he had detected acceleration,
it could not, I am very sure, have been justly ascribed
to any tremor or fear, but solely to the natural effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
solemn and riveted expectation. If a man, under such
circumstances, may trust to his own recollections not twenty-four
hours old, I can aver, on my honor, that I was not,
at any time while these events were in progress, under
other excitement (though it may be greater in degree) than
a chemist might be supposed to experience while watching
the issue of a long-projected and decisive experiment, or
an astronomer when the culminating point of some important
observation is about to be reached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg it may not be supposed that I mention this as
boasting or courage. There was, in truth, nothing of
which to boast. The preceding and attendant circumstances
were such as to preclude alarm. I was not alone,
nor taken by surprise. I was expecting some phenomena
and hoping that they would be of a phosphorescent nature.
And though I had not any expectation of seeing an actual
form, yet, as the allegation was that a deceased sister, beloved
by one of the assistants, was present, and as all the
demonstrations were gentle and seemingly arranged by
friendly agencies to satisfy my desire for the strongest
evidence in proof of Spiritual appearance, I was under
very different circumstances to those which have often
shaken the nerves even of the boldest, while encountering
for the first time what is usually called a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I state the fact of my equanimity, then, merely as one
of the attendant circumstances which may be fairly taken
into account in judging the testimony here supplied in
proof of the appearance, in visible and tangible form, of
an alleged Spirit of a deceased person. It is often assumed
that a man who believes he sees an apparition is (to use a
common expression) frightened out of his senses, and so,
is not entitled to credit as a witness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be objected that, before the sitting closed, the
doors were unlocked, I reply first, that all the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and interesting portion of the phenomena <em>occurred before
this happened</em>; and secondly, that, as the keys of the
locked doors were left in them, they could only be opened
from the inside. If, in reply to this last, it still be urged
that Mr. Underhill, deserting his post for a few seconds,
might have opened one of the doors, I reply that I happened
to be conversing with him at the moment we first
heard the key turned. I add that during the next sitting,
when still more wonderful phenomena occurred, I took a
precaution (as will be seen) which made it impossible that
either Mr. Underhill or any of the company should leave
their seats, even for a moment, without my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>A GHOST SPEAKS.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Five days after this I had the session here referred to,
in the same room, with the same assistants, during which
similar phenomena were repeated, but with one highly
noteworthy addition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The date was the twenty-sixth of October, 1860, and it
was an evening session, from half-past ten till midnight.
The same precautions which I had taken before the commencement
of the former sitting, as to locking all the
doors, looking under the table, examining the room and
furniture, etc., I carefully adopted on this occasion also.
As before, we waited until the servants had retired and all
was still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a time there was spelled &lsquo;Darken;&rsquo; then &lsquo;Join
hands.&rsquo; We obeyed; but on this occasion I took an additional
precaution. Grasping Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s right hand
and Charles&rsquo;s left, I brought my own hands to the centre
of the table, and Mr. Underhill, across the table, laid his
hands on mine. This we continued throughout the entire
sitting. I am able, therefore, to assert that, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
beginning of this sitting till the end, the circle remained
unbroken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a few minutes, there appeared a luminous body
of an irregularly circular form, about four inches in diameter,
floating between us and the door, which was back of
Mrs. Underhill. It was somewhat brighter than when it
first appeared on the previous occasion, that is, on the
twenty-first of October.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, after an interval, the light, rustling sound
seemed to indicate the approach of some one. The figure
was not so distinct as on the previous occasion, the lower
portion losing itself in a grayish cloud. The highest light
seemed to be on the spot corresponding to the forehead.
But I saw no features; nor did I see the arms moving.
Very soon I was gently touched on the head, then on the
shoulders, then laid hold of, as with both hands of some
one standing behind me. Then the figure seemed, by the
sound, to move away toward Mr. Underhill. He stated
that the figure was approaching him. He asked it if, as
a test, it could take something out of his pocket; but
there was no reply, by raps or otherwise. Immediately I
heard a sound as if some one were moving the key about
in the door opposite to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after Mr. Underhill said the figure had again approached
him. I saw the illuminated circular substance
close to his head, but could not distinguish any figure.
Mr. Underhill said that he could dimly discern the figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a time it moved round to the lad Charles, who
exhibited much alarm, crying out, &lsquo;Oh, go away! pray
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; when it approached, as I saw it do, close to his
head, which he had bent down on the table. It was now
very bright, so that, by the light, I could see the outline
of the boy&rsquo;s head. Charles afterward stated that he saw
it distinctly, and that a hand touched him repeatedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
While it was close to Charles, it appeared to me as if a
white handkerchief or some article of the like texture were
thrown over a hand or some similar support. I saw no
figure. When it rose behind Charles, as if to leave him
when he cried out, I could perceive what resembled a hand
grasping some illuminated substance, the outline of the
hand appearing as a shadow across the illuminated ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it moved, as I could see, to Mr. Underhill, and
after a time crossed over to me, and touched me gently on
the shoulder. Of a sudden it occurred to me that one
other evidence was lacking. I expressed a desire that, if
it could, it would speak. It seemed to make several efforts
to do so, as indicated by a slight, guttural sound; then I
heard a sound resembling the syllable <em>es</em>, twice repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, by the raps, was spelled out, &lsquo;Sing.&rsquo; Mrs. Underhill
complied. The figure which had seemed to move
away and return, again touched me from behind, drawing
me slightly toward it. Then, in a brief interval of the
singing, I heard, in a low voice, just behind me, &lsquo;God
bless you.&rsquo; As additional assurance that it was no momentary
illusion, I asked that it would speak again; and
again, in an interval of the music, I heard, in distinct
tones, the same words, &lsquo;God bless you.&rsquo; They seemed
to be pronounced close to my ear. The voice was low&mdash;apparently
a woman&rsquo;s voice&mdash;just louder than a whisper,
and the words seemed to be pronounced with an effort, in
subdued tones, as a person faint from sickness might speak.
I particularly noticed, also, that each word was pronounced
separately, with a perceptible interval between, and there
was not the usual accent on <em>bless</em>, followed by the shortened
<em>you</em>; but each word was equally accented. In other
respects the sound resembled the human voice, when low
and gentle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Underhill afterward stated to me that she distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the word <em>you</em>, but not the others. Mr. Underhill
said he had heard articulate sounds, but could not make
out any of the words; he only knew that something had
been said to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a time I saw the figure pass behind Mrs. Underhill
and remain, for a few minutes, near her husband;
then it returned to me, appearing on my left side. I saw
the outline of a head and face, but still, as before, covered
with a veil which concealed the features. I perceived,
however, what I had not observed before, what seemed
tresses of dark hair dropping over the face, and the dim
outline of an arm raised one of these tresses, and then
dropped it again, several times, as if to attract my attention.
Behind was the vague outline of a figure, but less
distinct than during the previous sitting. Then the figure
passed behind me. I was leaning over the table, so that
Mr. Underhill might not have so far to stretch in order to
reach my hands. I felt a kiss on my shoulders, then there
was the feeling of two hands laid each on one shoulder, and
I was drawn very gently back till my shoulders, above the
chair back, were pressed against what seemed a material
form. Almost at the same moment my hand was kissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Underhill cried out, &lsquo;Ah, you were drawn back;&rsquo;
and Mrs. Underhill said, a little impatiently, &lsquo;Every one
is touched but me. Can&rsquo;t you come to me?&rsquo; The words
were hardly pronounced when she screamed out, as in
alarm; she had been suddenly and unexpectedly kissed on
the forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that very moment the manifestations entirely
ceased. No luminous object to be seen, not another touch,
not a rustle, not a sound of any kind in the room. I listened
attentively, and am certain that no door opened or
shut, and scarcely a minute or two elapsed ere it was
spelled out, &lsquo;Light the gas.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When we had done so we found everything as before,
with a single exception. I ascertained by looking under
the table and in the pantry that there was no one in the
room but ourselves; I found all the three doors locked,
but the key belonging to the door opposite to me was
missing. We asked where it was; the raps replied,
&lsquo;Look.&rsquo; We could not see it anywhere. Then we examined
our pockets, and, from one of his coat-pockets Mr.
Underhill produced a key which was found to fit the door.
Mrs. Underhill asked if her alarmed exclamation had injured
the Spirit?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer by the raps: &lsquo;Not much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. U.: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so <em>much</em> afraid I hurt her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer: &lsquo;It frightened her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question (by me): &lsquo;Did Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s cry of alarm
cause the manifestations to cease?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer: &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the door-key, I remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Mr. Underhill asked, as a test, to have something
taken from his pocket; but it was a better test, since he
could not move from his place to take the key from the
door and deposit it in his pocket. Who <em>but</em> a Spirit could
take it, our circle remaining unbroken? Is the taking
by Spirit agency incredible? But the hands that pressed
my shoulders, that grasped my hand, that clasped my
wrist, were surely material enough to extract a key from a
door-lock and drop it into a pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then all the doors, this time, were left locked, so that
no one could enter from without; to say nothing of the
absurd supposition that a Spirit should open a door in order
to admit human assistants.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo; p.&nbsp;467.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">SPIRIT CURES&mdash;MR. CAPRON&rsquo;S WIFE.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Statement by E.&nbsp;W. Capron&mdash;Wife of General Waddy Thompson,
of South Carolina&mdash;Wife of Mr. Davis of Providence,
R.&nbsp;I.</p>


<p>I might fill many pages with my reminiscences under
this head, but I now confine myself to three instances, the
first in order being also the first in my experience. I take
it partly for that reason, and partly because it contains the
features of the temporary transfer to myself of the affection
removed from the sufferer, and also of the cure having
been performed <em>at a distance</em>.</p>


<h3 class="f10">I.</h3>

<p class="center f8">STATEMENT BY E.&nbsp;W. CAPRON.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the occasion of my first visit at the house of the Fox
sisters, then living in Prospect Street, Rochester, I mentioned
casually that my wife was afflicted with a very
severe and troublesome cough. Nothing more was said
about it at the time, but as we sat quietly conversing with
and about the &lsquo;Spirits,&rsquo; Leah seemed suddenly entranced
and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to cure Rebecca&rsquo;s cough.&rsquo; It was no
sooner said than done. She visited her mentally and described
her accurately, and pronounced her cured. I returned
to my home (Auburn) and found her entirely well.
I expressed surprise, and asked her how she became so
suddenly cured? She said she did not herself understand
it, as her cough had left her since &lsquo;night before last.&rsquo;
Her cough was cured and never returned.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;E.&nbsp;W. Capron.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquo3">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;I will add that the cough was transferred to myself with equal
violence to that which had tormented Mrs. Capron. My family at times
feared that I might rupture a blood-vessel. (Why did the Spirits not
relieve me too?) It lasted for about a week, when my mother sent for
Professor E.&nbsp;C. Rogers, a powerful mesmerizer who happened to be
lecturing in Rochester at the time, who by his magnetic power and
manipulations gave me prompt and complete relief. He was not a
&ldquo;Spiritualist,&rdquo; nor am I able to say exactly what his philosophy was.
He afterward published an 8vo volume of about 330 pages, entitled,
&ldquo;Philosophy of Mysterious Agents, Human and Mundane; or, Dynamic
Laws and Relations of Man,&rdquo; etc.<br />

<h3 class="f10">II.</h3>

<p class="center f8">WIFE OF GENERAL WADDY THOMPSON, OF SOUTH CAROLINA.</p>

<p>General Waddy Thompson was a widower when I first
knew him (he had met my mother and sisters in Washington,
in 1852). Subsequently he attended my séances frequently.
On the occasion I now speak of (in the fall of
1857), he called to make an engagement with me to see
him and his young, second wife, who was an invalid. As
they were going to start for home the next morning, he
wished to come that afternoon. It was cold, and the snow
and frozen rain came down heavily, but at the appointed
time a carriage drove to the door, and Mrs. Thompson was
carried into the house by two men. She was beautiful
alike in person and in character. Her lameness and great
suffering, which she had endured for over four years, had
had their origin in milk fever, which had settled in her
leg, and had baffled the skill of the most renowned physicians
of Europe and America.</p>

<p>The manifestations of Spirit presence came freely, and
very soon Mrs. Thompson cried out, &ldquo;Oh! something is
taking hold of my limbs with hands!&rdquo; The General
begged her to sit still, saying, &ldquo;Do not stir, my dear; it
is your Spirit guardian who loves you.&rdquo; She wept and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
called on her mother&rsquo;s Spirit to come, saying, &ldquo;Dear
mother, I want you to go with me where I go, and watch
over us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson was cured, and walked back without
difficulty from Ludlow Place to the St. Nicholas Hotel.</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1859, she and her lovely sister, Miss
Jones, accompanied the General to New York, and on
learning that it was our reception night, came to enjoy the
evening with us, and related the circumstances before a
very large party.</p>


<h3 class="f10">III.</h3>

<p class="center f8">WIFE OF MR. DAVIS, OF PROVIDENCE, R.&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>The third I save myself the trouble of writing by copying
it from Robert Dale Owen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Debatable Land,&rdquo; page
513. But in doing so I correct an error of <em>date</em> which was
natural enough on the part of Mrs. Davis in a narration
made in 1862 of an occurrence which had taken place some
five years before. In point of fact it occurred in 1857,
while I resided in my house, No. 1 Ludlow Place. She
erroneously makes it February, 1858, instead of 1857.
My marriage with Mr. Underhill was on the 2d of November,
1858. Of course I was not &ldquo;Mrs. Underhill,&rdquo; but
Mrs. Brown, at the time of this extraordinary cure; though
it was natural that Mrs. Davis in 1862 should speak of me
by the name which had then been mine for about four
years; and also that this should have misled Mr. Owen,
and caused him to understand the case as having occurred
after I had become Mrs. U. The reader will therefore, in
perusing this narrative, simply change the word &ldquo;Underhill&rdquo;
to Brown. With that unimportant correction, the
whole of it is strictly true. See letter from Mrs. Davis to
me, written on her return home from this visit, dated
August 8, 1857, page <a href="#Page_391">391</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><i>Paralysis of the Motor Nerve.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the month of February, 1858, a lady, the wife of Mr.
Davis, of Providence, R.&nbsp;I., was residing at her home in
the immediate vicinity of that city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happened, one morning, when a large and powerful
horse was standing harnessed in front of the house, that a
servant, passing carelessly close to the animal with a child&rsquo;s
carriage in which was an infant daughter of Mrs. Davis,
accidentally dropped the tongue of the carriage close to the
horse&rsquo;s heels. Mrs. Davis, seeing the danger of her child,
rushed to the horse&rsquo;s head, and seizing him suddenly by
the bridle with her right hand, the animal reared violently
so as almost to lift her from her feet. She succeeded,
however, in leading him off from her child, which thus escaped
unhurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the moment she experienced no pain; afterward she
went about her usual occupations, but felt faint and languid
throughout the day. About ten o&rsquo;clock <span class="lower">P.M.</span>, sitting
down to supper, she first noticed a pain in her elbow, and
then, when she attempted to use her right hand, was unable
to do so; she found it impossible to close three of the
fingers of that hand, the index-finger alone obeying the
impulse of her will. After a time the pain increased and
extended above the elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the course of the night the right leg also became
affected, the pain extending to the hip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning she discovered that she could not, by
any effort of the will, move either the right arm or the
right leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The physicians declared it to be a case of paralysis of
the motor nerves, caused chiefly by sudden excitement.
For a long time it resisted all remedies. During seven
weeks the paralysis continued unabated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In all that time she never used hand or arm: when she
walked she had to drag the right leg after her. The leg,
too, became cold even to the hip, and all efforts to warm
it were ineffectual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the month of April she experienced slight relief by
the frequent use of electricity; but only so far that, by a
special effort of the will, she could partially move her hand
and arm. Habitually she rested the elbow on her hip, or,
when sitting in an arm-chair, raised it with the other hand
so as to rest it on the chair-arm. Nor did she ever, until
the incident about to be related, regain the power of
straightening either leg or arm. Nor was the warmth of
the leg at all restored; and when she walked she still had
to drag it after her along the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This continued, without alteration or improvement,
until the month of July, 1858; and by this time she had
become comparatively disheartened. Life seemed to her no
longer worth having: a cripple for life, a burden to her
friends, useless to her family. She gave way to tears and
despondency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the early part of July a friend, Mrs. J., wife of
a gentleman well known in New York literary circles<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and
who had been staying with Mrs. Davis, proposed to close
her visit and return to that city. Suddenly Mrs. Davis
experienced an impulse for which she could not at all account.
It was an urgent desire to go to New York and
visit Mrs. Underhill (Leah Fox), with whom she was not
acquainted, having merely heard of her through Mrs. J.
She said to that lady (Mrs. J.) that if she would remain
with her a day longer, she (Mrs. Davis) would accompany
her to New York and visit Mrs. Underhill in hope of relief.
Mrs. J. consenting, they left Providence on the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of July 3d, notwithstanding the doubts expressed by
Mr. Davis whether his wife would be able to endure the
journey, reached New York next morning, and proceeded
at once to Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Davis was so much exhausted on her arrival, that
she retired to a private room until the afternoon, when
she, Mrs. J., and Mrs. Underhill met in the parlor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loud raps being heard, it was proposed to sit down at
the centre-table. It being but three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
there was bright day-light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after the ladies sat down, all their hands being on
the table, Mrs. Davis felt the ankle of her right leg seized
as by the firm grasp of a human hand, the foot raised, and
the heel placed in what seemed another hand.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The touch
of the fingers and thumb was unmistakably distinct, and
indicated that it was a right hand which grasped the ankle,
while a left hand received the heel. After a time the hand
which had seized the ankle released its grasp, and Mrs.
Davis felt it make passes down the leg. These passes
were continued about ten minutes. Mrs. Davis felt a sensation
as of the circulation pervading the paralyzed limb;
and the natural warmth, of which it had been for months
deprived, gradually returned. At the expiration of about
ten minutes, there was spelled out by raps: &lsquo;Rise and
walk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Davis arose and found, with an amazement which
she said no words could describe, that she could walk as
well as she had ever done in her life. She paced up and
down the room to assure herself that it was a reality: the
pain, the paralysis were gone; she could use the hitherto
disabled leg as freely as the other. After more than four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
months of suffering and of decrepitude, she found the
natural warmth and vigor of the limb suddenly and (as it
would be commonly phrased) miraculously restored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This terminated the sitting for the time; the <em>arm</em> still
remaining paralyzed as before. But late in the evening,
after the departure of several visitors, the ladies sat down
again. This time, by rapping, a request was made to
darken the room. After a brief delay the arm was manipulated
as the leg had been, but with more force, as if
rubbed downward from the shoulder by a smooth and
somewhat elastic piece of metal, like the steel busk sometimes
used in ladies&rsquo; stays. After this had been continued
for some time, what seemed to the touch a steel busk was
laid in Mrs. Davis&rsquo;s right hand, and, by raps, a request
was spelled out to close the fingers upon it. This she
found herself able to do with a firm grasp. Then the
busk was drawn forcibly from her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From that time forth she recovered the use of her arm
as completely as she had that of her leg. Nor has she had

<br />
<span class="f8">MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">J. Heddon&mdash;S. Chamberlain&mdash;John E. Robinson&mdash;A. Underhill&mdash;George
Lee, M.&nbsp;D.</p>


<p>The two following letters, from Mr. Heddon and Judge
Chamberlain to me, I take from <cite>The Cleveland Plaindealer</cite>,
in which paper they are thus prefaced by the editor:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>More Testimony.</i>&mdash;Some friends of Mrs. Fish, on learning
her intended visit to this city, gave her many flattering
letters, signifying their great esteem for her and confidence
in the &lsquo;good cause,&rsquo; as they call it, of the doctrine of Spiritualism.
Among the many such testimonials we select the
following from J. Heddon, Esq., and Judge Chamberlain,
men of the first standing in their community.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>J. HEDDON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Stafford</span>, May 9, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Respected Madam</span>: As Mr. Chamberlain and myself
left Rochester before we had an opportunity of copying
those Spiritual manifestations, I will now transcribe and
send them to you by mail, and Mr. Chamberlain engages
to do the same. You are at perfect liberty to make any
use you may think proper of mine, including or omitting
the name, as you may think best; for I am alike indifferent
to frowns or flattery. I feel a lively interest in the cause,
and I believe many of my friends will be induced to pay
you a visit on your return from the West; and most assuredly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
your humble servant among the rest. The communications
I copy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbatim</i> on the other side of the sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wishing you a pleasant and successful visit to Cleveland,
I am</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Your most ob&rsquo;t servant,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;J. Heddon.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Stafford</span>, May 9, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are aware that, for the first time, I had manifestations
on my person of the presence of Spirits at your house
on Thursday last, after which I received the following communication
from my Spirit friends. My wife thus addressed
me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear: I am with you always; in the silent hour
of midnight, when all is quiet, I rest upon your bosom and
bless you, and keep you safe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Message to her Child.</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Teach her to know her mother
watches over her; tell her she has a mother &ldquo;still living,&rdquo;
teach her to know that death hath no terror&mdash;the transition
from Earth to Heaven is past description; we shall
all be again united. All is well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of my father then said: &lsquo;I sanction all she
has said&mdash;the Truth will rise triumphant&mdash;the cause is good.
God rules victorious.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In answer to a question whether I should have manifestations
at home, my wife replied, &lsquo;I will make sounds
upon your pillows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of a recently departed brother said, &lsquo;Tell her
(our mother) I thought of her when I was dying, and desired
to see you all, but when my soul was released I came
to your abode, and was greatly delighted with my privileges.
Things will change with you, and you will rejoice
and know the truth.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The numerous test questions I kept no record of, and
consequently they are omitted here.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;J. Heddon.</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;N.&nbsp;B. My brother died far away from home, which
accounts for the above message to his mother.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>S. CHAMBERLAIN.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Le Roy, N.&nbsp;Y.</span>, May 10, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. A.&nbsp;L. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I herewith annex a copy of an account of some incidents
which occurred at your house on the 7th inst. The
following <em>mental</em> questions were asked and replied to by
the Spirits in the usual manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked if the Spirit I then had in my mind were
present? Answer, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then asked if the Spirit would give me a message.
The alphabet was called for and the following was spelled
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I used to oppose the subject. I departed this life
within the last year; I am convinced of the reality of these
things now. I visited Mrs. Fish soon after I left the mortal
body, and was pleased with my interview. I scorned
the idea of visiting her when I lived on earth, but now I
am delighted to call occasionally and listen to the communications.
I wish I had known something more about
these things before I left the earth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him to give me the letters of his name; which
he did. This I considered a good test, as no one present
could know whom I had in my mind; and the fact of his
death and opinions on this subject were true, as I had
been intimately acquainted with him for a period of twenty
years, and had had many interviews with him on the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I then asked, mentally, for the Spirit of a new acquaintance,
with whom I had a misunderstanding while in
life, which was not settled at his death. I asked him,
mentally, what he had to say on the subject? The alphabet
was called for, and said, &lsquo;We are good friends again.
All differences are now settled forever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I then said, mentally, &lsquo;Perhaps I was wrong.&rsquo; He said,
&lsquo;No, I was in fault.&rsquo; I asked him to spell his first name,
which he did. I asked the Spirit of my father-in-law if I
should have a medium in my family. He answered, by
alphabet, &lsquo;You have a medium in your family already;&rsquo;
which was true. I asked in what way. He replied, &lsquo;A
medium in writing.&rsquo; This was also true. I asked him to
spell his name, which he declined. I asked him why the
Spirits declined, generally, to give their names. He answered,
&lsquo;That would convince the sceptic too easily.&rsquo; He
then said, &lsquo;No good thing can be obtained without some
labor&mdash;the husbandman must till his ground before it will
bring forth much fruit.&rsquo; There were many other questions
and answers that I consider equally good tests, but
have no time to give them now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wishing you much pleasure and true friends through
life,</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">I am very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;S. Chamberlain.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>This Judge Chamberlain was one of the most respectable
citizens of Le Roy, N.&nbsp;Y.</p>


<h3>JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, May 23, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah</span>: Your letter was received two
days since, and I thank your punctuality in thus early remembering
not to forget me. The accompanying half-sheet
was very welcome to Rachel. You could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
have written more, under the circumstances. I will therefore
excuse you for not giving me a particular account of
things up to the date when yours was penned. I shall,
however, expect a long letter from you soon, written all to
me, and as the warfare has, by this time, fairly opened between
our friends, the Spirits, and their antagonists in
Cleveland, you will have enough to tell me. The result of
the &lsquo;passage at arms&rsquo; is, of course, not doubtful to any who,
like me, are aware of the temper of the weapons which
the Spirits wield against their opponents. But we are all
interested, exceedingly so, in looking on, while the battle
is waged in a new field, with fresh antagonists confident in
their own strength because ignorant of the power of the
opposing force. It is amusing, this confidence of inflated
ignorance! but it is such a universal weakness, that we
can hardly any longer wonder at its manifestation. You
have so often witnessed it, and have so often triumphed
over those who came to sneer and scoff at you, that I think
you can well afford now to keep your temper well harnessed
on such occasions, and let your auditors see how calm, how
confident you are, while awaiting their overthrow. Why,
Leah, you can afford to wear a smile and confront, with an
unflashing eye, the deriding, sneering sceptic, or even the
enraged bigot, who backs his authoritative condemnation
by relating falsehoods that have been a thousand times
refuted. &lsquo;But it is difficult,&rsquo; say you, &lsquo;for me to be <em>more</em>
than mortal.&rsquo; I know it, and doubt very much if I could
be half as patient as you are. But I am at a <em>safe distance</em>,
and have hazarded giving you (very modestly) this quiet
hint. The application of whalebone to a man&rsquo;s back <em>may</em>
help his manners and regulate the movements of his tongue
and pen, but it is not very apt to convince his reason. Mr.
Sackett, probably, is quite aware of this; and his administration
of the corrective was evidently intended for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
moral improvement of the <cite>Herald</cite> man. You wish he
(Mr. S.) would come and mete out such justice to the
Rochester editorial fraternity. I do not. They are not
<em>worth</em> the <em>trouble</em> of horse-whipping, and besides, only be
patient, Leah, and you will see them yet so confoundedly
trounced by the Spirits, that it will last them till the orthodox
judgment day damns them. It is to be hoped you
are wise enough to retire from company sufficiently early
in the evening to give you time for rest. There is scarcely
anything which more destroys one&rsquo;s equanimity of mind
than this neglect of rest. Now will you remember and
take care of yourself? I have not yet done with you, for
this reason&mdash;you need scolding once in a while, and have
but few friends who are willing to do it; so I shall remind
you, on all proper occasions, of your delinquencies. It occurred
to me the other day that we were wrong in so often
thinking, latterly, that Spiritualism had made but little
advance in some time. It is true, so far as our knowledge
is concerned; and the number of mediums for Spiritual
communications seems very limited. But all this while
the subject has been taking hold of people&rsquo;s minds in <em>all
parts of the country</em>. They do not stop thinking because
a few church conferences and priest-ridden journalists tell
them to. Editors who have some independence will write,
and their readers will digest anything which is made palatable
by the semblance of candor. There is, perhaps, no
one subject which is more thought of throughout this
country and Europe at this very time than these Spirit,
demonstrations. I believe you will go to England and
France; but when, and how, and under what auspices, I
will not try to guess. Tell Calvin I am obliged for the
papers sent by him. I have not seen any of the inmates of
your house since you left. I would call there if there were
any necessity, but you have left matters in safe custody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say to your sister Maria I hope the journey affords her
pleasure, both in seeing a part of the beauties of the great
West and in rendering you assistance, who so often want
a sister upon whom you can lean and rely with confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My best regards to her and Calvin, as well as yourself.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>A. UNDERHILL.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cleveland, O.</span>, June 19, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend Leah</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you will appreciate the motive that prompts
me to write this to you. I have thought much on the
subject, and will make a few suggestions. Your position,
as a family, before the world, is now of great importance.
The fact of communicating with Spirits has not only been
fully established in the minds of a few, but is becoming
generally acknowledged by the intelligent world. Your
record will necessarily form a great part of the history of
the world from this time onward, and though your present
trials and perplexities seem past endurance, yet patience
and perseverance, until a final triumph overtakes you,
should be your polar star and watchword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ever have been martyrs for truth&rsquo;s sake, and ever
will be; and though it may be grievous to bear the taunts
and sneers of the ignorant, self-wise, and conceited bigot,
yet, if the cause demands it we must endure the sacrifice
and look beyond for the reward. I, who have battled for
years with the enemies of progress, have become inured to
their unblushing insolence, and while I handle their errors
without much mercy, I pity their ignorance. <em>You</em> are
differently situated, and <em>severely tried</em> on every hand, but
you are enlisted in the good cause, and you must not look
back but upward and onward. Thousands are joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
your ranks, and your banner floats over the world. We
are all fighting the good fight of faith, and our motto is,
&lsquo;Truth and justice to all mankind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other mediums are being developed, and their name
will soon be legion, their power and influence irresistible.
Already might you as well try to turn back the waters of
the Niagara as to stay the onward march of the cause in
which you and your family have been selected to take the
lead and &lsquo;fight the good fight.&rsquo; My dear Leah, remember
the &lsquo;wise man&rsquo; who &lsquo;built his house upon a rock, and the
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was
founded upon a rock.&rsquo; Let &lsquo;false prophets&rsquo; arise (as I
know they will) and &lsquo;come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.&rsquo;
You are in the right and have nothing to fear. Many,
too, will try to usurp your rights, but trust in God. &lsquo;Fear
not, neither be dismayed.&rsquo; Take courage, then, my dear
friend, and do not despair. Fight with reason, truth, and
prudence, but never surrender to cowardly slander or
bigoted insolence; never, never!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what I wish to say is this: The relations in
which you stand to the origin of this unbounded subject,
make it highly important that your whole history should
be carefully preserved. In fact, you should keep a daily
journal, and record therein the progress and developments
of this new (and to many) startling science&mdash;for so I deem
it. The fact is that your names must form an inseparable
part of the history of modern Spiritualism, and it is important
that you should have that justice which the truth alone
can give you. Hence, while it is fresh in the mind, your
mother, yourself, or some one should carefully collect and
arrange these early facts, in such a way as to secure them
and place them where they belong, beyond all doubt or
argument; and also, as far as is in your power, you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
enter daily, if but two or three times, the distinguished
names of your daily investigators, the names of the places
you visit, and the thousand calls &lsquo;to come&rsquo; from every
part of the United States and from Europe. Do not
neglect or deem it unimportant, for the time will come
when it will be deeply regretted (if not by you) by those
who come after you. Without saying more at this time,
please accept my best wishes, and be assured of my
co-operation and willingness to share with you all the jeers
and taunts of sceptics or obstinate bigots. I much prefer
the former, as there is more hope for the sceptic than the
bigot. I choose to stand with a few who are in the right
rather than with the many in the wrong. Smiles or
frowns are alike unheeded when they come from the ignorant
or <em>self-wise</em>.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Most truly and respectfully your friend,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;A. Underhill.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<h3>GEORGE LEE, M.D.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barré, Mass.</span>, June 30, 1851.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Ann L. Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>&mdash;I address you almost as a stranger,
although I had the honor of a short acquaintance at your
place in Rochester, last September. I was at your house
on the same day with several clergymen from Massachusetts.
I was then on my way to Mt. Morris on business.
A lady from Mt. Morris visited you, a Mrs. Mashon (an
acquaintance of yours). While I was stopping there
at her house, she informed me that yourself and sisters
were about to leave home for a time, and I was much disappointed
on finding you were all absent when I returned,
as I was then anxious to further investigate those mysterious
manifestations. I felt that I had been severely
scathed in this world by the loss of all our children; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
although I was educated strictly in the orthodox church
and its tenets, yet I was somewhat sceptical in regard to
the soul&rsquo;s immortality. You cannot wonder that I should
seek confirmation of the soul&rsquo;s future life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When, therefore, I heard those mysterious sounds for
the first time at your house, it produced a thrill of joy, as
being the strongest evidence of a future life that I had
ever met with; and though I was satisfied that there was
no trick, no collusion in the sounds, yet I have not been
so certain that it might not be some newly developed or
newly elaborated electrical effect; yet the evidence is in
favor of its Spirituality. It is the most natural solution
of the whole subject, and I should regret, as much as any
one, to have it prove otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied that the mediums are honest and unconscious
of the primary cause of the phenomena. I am
somewhat acquainted with Swedenborg&rsquo;s writings, and
very well acquainted with A.&nbsp;J. Davis and his writings.
I consider Davis and his writings among the greatest wonders
of the world. That a young man, without education,
without even having read books, should have given to the
world such far-reaching thought and profound philosophy,
upon the most abstruse and metaphysical subjects, is a
marvel indeed! The history of mankind cannot produce
a parallel fact. And yet we do not suppose he has no
errors. He does not claim infallibility. In &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s
Divine Revelations&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Let then what I am impressed
to state, be received as true or rejected as false,
as it addresses itself to your judgment, or according to its
appeals to your reason.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The highest angel in the universe could not give the
whole philosophy of the universe, because that Spirit does
not possess a perfect knowledge of <em>all things</em>; and I have
seen many criticisms of Mr. Davis&rsquo;s writings, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
generally show that the writers of them do not comprehend
him; and although some strictures may be just, the great
majority of them evince a real misapprehension on the
part of their authors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Le Roy Sunderland has made two: one upon Mr.
Davis&rsquo;s recent work, &lsquo;The Philosophy of Spiritual Intercourse.&rsquo;
In both of Mr. Sunderland&rsquo;s criticisms he shows
his own want of discrimination. Dr. Gridley has another
article in <cite>The Spirit World</cite> as a criticism of Davis. It
darkens knowledge with words. They do not take a very
comprehensive view of Davis&rsquo;s philosophy. They seem
to forget that Davis uses language figuratively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am somewhat acquainted with Mr. Sunderland, have
been at his house recently, and heard the rappings in
presence of his daughter, Mrs. Cooper, as a medium. The
rappings are obscure&mdash;not more than one-quarter as loud
or as distinct as I have heard them at your house&mdash;much
of the time so light as scarcely to be heard; yet I was
satisfied at the time that they were the same kind of
sounds. I have been before several other mediums; the
sounds are all much smaller than at your house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sunderland seems to be unsettled in his mind
about the Spirit world, and about the Spirits being good
or bad, or <em>how much</em> evil; and is rather disposed to fall in
with Swedenborg, at present, on that subject. Mr. Sunderland
will do some good with his paper, but I regret
some of his articles. This criticism upon Davis is most
unjust and uncalled for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am confident Mr. Davis is more correct, more consistent
in his philosophy of the Bible and the Spirit world,
than Swedenborg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nature and Reason is the standard whereby Davis
directs to test all these subjects. God manifesting himself
in Nature, in the Universe, is a true revelation to man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
and whatever corresponds to the philosophy as discovered
in Nature is truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a revelation is given us not in harmony with philosophy
which is <em>known</em> to be true, then that revelation is
false. Davis&rsquo;s standard and general philosophy cannot be
overthrown; Davis sometimes being himself in sympathy
with higher or purer Spirits, may use language to convey
too high or too pure conceptions of the Spirit world; but if
Davis is too high, Swedenborg is too low. His hells are
inconsistent with a God of wisdom; and if the doctrine of
progressive development can be established, or is true, as I
think it is, then Swedenborg&rsquo;s doctrines are not all true;
but that is the great doctrine of Davis&rsquo;s philosophy, and if
it is true, it is all we need. Ultimately we must all become
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although Swedenborg was a very learned and good
man, and was Spiritually enlightened while on earth, yet
his mind was trammelled by his preconceived theological
views. Davis&rsquo;s mind is under less bias, and more free. I
am well convinced his writings are destined to produce a
great effect upon Christendom. Such men, or writers, as
Sunderland, Farrald, and others who follow Swedenborg
in part, do not seem to take in the whole ground in one
view. They view the Universe in fragmentary parts.
They do not seem to consider that a certain relation exists
between all things. That</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;All are but parts of one stupendous whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that Law is necessary as Light; all is an effect of the same
interior cause. The higher could not exist without the
lower; and surely without the lower there could be no
progress, and without the parts the whole could not exist.
Higher and lower, evil and good, heat and cold, are relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
terms, comparatively positive or negative. I have not
written one word of what I intended to write, and what I
especially requested a reply to. So you see that nearly my
whole letter is a digression. But now to the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I correspond with the Rev. A. Wilder, of Syracuse,
N.&nbsp;Y., who lately wrote to me that a Doctor Boynton, an
itinerant lecturer, had been at Syracuse and informed
him and Prof. Bush, of New York City, and others, that
he, the said Boynton, had been at your place at Rochester,
and was there informed by a cousin to yourself (a lady)
how the rappings were made, and that it was all a trick
done in various ways, by the toes and by the fingers, etc.
Dr. Boynton said that he pretended to be friendly, got
communication with his father&rsquo;s Spirit (who was not dead),
and then he detected this lady in rapping and charged her
with it; and she owned up to him and taught him how to
rap, which he was practising. To me this seemed absurd
and like a falsehood. I replied to my friend, and used
some pretty strong language to convince him that Dr.
Boynton was an impostor, a deceiver, a liar, and unworthy
of credit. I said to him that a man who went to your
place and was permitted to investigate the matter fairly,
&lsquo;without money and without price,&rsquo; and then went around
the country telling such stories, would not need his ears
much lengthened to bray, and what I wondered most at
was, that Prof. Bush and Rev. A. Wilder, M.D.&mdash;for he
has both letters prefixed to his name&mdash;should give any
credit to him. But, notwithstanding this, friend Wilder
writes me again and says he has no reason to question the
veracity of Dr. Boynton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I wish you to reply to me and give me the facts
in this case, so that I may be able to know them, and relate
them to my friends, Doctor Wilder and Prof. Bush.
These two men are both Swedenborgian preachers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Dr. Wilder is also a medical lecturer in the medical school
in Syracuse. A.&nbsp;J. Davis says, in his recent work on
Spiritual intercourse, that the mediums sometimes may
produce the rapping or other manifestations unconsciously
to themselves: being impressed by the Spirits or a strong
desire to do what the Spirits are about to do, or what they
greatly desire themselves. Whether anything of the kind
occurs with yourself or sisters, I never learned. If so,
candidly and honestly inform me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are things which we shall all better understand
by and by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. A.&nbsp;J. Davis a few days ago. He says, &lsquo;There
is a better time coming.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know whether this will
reach you at Rochester. I believe you are much absent.
I heard from you in Buffalo through a Mrs. Bond, of Mt.
Morris. You will recollect a rather tall, light-complexioned
lady who had lost a sister and infant. She read to me her
questions and answers to them before yourself and sister
Margaretta. This lady is talented, one of earth&rsquo;s progressive
spirits. She first informed me of the opposition you
met with in Buffalo. Since then I have noticed in the
papers your reply, etc., to Doctors Lee, Flint, and Coventry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my sympathy in your trials. It appears to
me that you have great reason to rejoice that you were instrumental,
in the hands of Supreme Powers, in giving to
the world a more substantial assurance of an immortality,
and you have, through the tests you freely submitted to,
forever silenced the theory of C. Chauncy Burr, and put
to shame his emissaries. I have but little fellowship with

<h3>JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, March 23, 1852.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah</span>: It is alike a pleasure and a duty
for me to thank you for your very welcome letter, which
came to hand this morning. A letter from you had become
of so rare occurrence, that this was, I assure you,
particularly pleasant to me. It reminded me forcibly of
some favors of the kind which past years bear record of,
and which served, in no slight degree, to give me those
more pleasurable emotions in which consists the happiness
of life. I thank you very much for the message transmitted.
There is something in the communication <em>very
like that sister</em> from whom it purports to come. So like,
that after reading it and pondering upon the language, I
fell into a half reverie, and imagined I could see through
the veil that separates us, and could read in the eyes that
looked lovingly upon her brother, a confirmation of that
which your pen transcribed for me. I will keep it a long
time, as a remembrance, and will be again obliged, whenever
a repetition of the favor may be experienced without
taxing your patience and generosity beyond its friendly
bounds. I presume I should have become a medium long
ago if my condition had been suitable; I have no doubt of
the wisdom of the Spirits in refraining from intrusting
me with the commission such mediumship would have imposed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
My nervous temperament is somewhat peculiar,
and I am quite satisfied now that I would have been a poor
servant of the cause, if anything like a position in the front
ranks of it had been assigned me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it is I am as ever a deeply interested spectator of
the events as they transpire, and looking, with entire and
unflagging confidence, for the time coming when the more
glorious fruits of these newly developed truths will ripen
for the eye best fitted to appreciate them. I think, sometimes,
that this Spiritualism advances upon the world of
mind as the inflowing tide of ocean floods the shore. It
seems to come in waves; each succeeding one beats further
upon the strand than its predecessor. Is it not so?
And is there not in the one an approximation to the
grandeur of the other? But you never stood, when a
child, on Newport beach, and may not see the meaning of
my remark. I have tried to watch these things clearly,
and, without a spirit of assumption, I think I may say I
have made no great mistake in the matter in its earliest
stage. I predicted the very course, on the part of the
priesthood, which they have since taken (see Charles
Beecher&rsquo;s report). I claim no shrewdness for this, because
it is the only one they can take and maintain themselves
to their last hour. It is their last stronghold! and when
that falls they fall with it. Now of your proposed visit to
Rochester. The friends will, of course, be very glad to
see you, and will expect you to make less haste to get away.
I told Isaac what you said about it, but have not yet seen
Amy. Her health is much improved, and she is the same
blessed woman she ever was, and, I know, wants to have a
good visit from you and Katie Fox.</p>

<h3>SAME.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, May 23, 1852.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have really broken your long and persevering
silence! I am obliged to you for the letter, which was received
last evening, and especially for the postscript added
thereunto. You know it is said that a woman&rsquo;s letter is
never finished without a <span class="lower">P. S.</span>; but it is seldom so generous
in its dimensions, or so full of sentiment, as to outweigh
that to which it is appended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dishonest world this is! Your letter is half
cheerful, half sad; and I, who know your life about as
well as any one, do not wonder that it should be so. I am
thankful, Leah, that the Recording Angel always tells
a straight story upon the pages of his manuscript; thankful
for myself, for you, and for others, that we are not to be
judged in that Court whose sentence is final upon ex-parte
evidence. Had my lot in early life been cast as yours
was, I do not think I should be as good as you are, or even
as happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this task which the Spirits have imposed upon
you of late years, is anything but a light one. It has its
brighter side, as I well know, its lightening influences;
and were this not the case, no one, not even yourself, could
endure the wear constant and severe, upon the mind, for
a single year. I can only advise you (just here), as I often
have, to devote sufficient time to rest; and do not rob
yourself of that which nature demands, and which she <em>will
have</em> or impose a penalty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to know that you find friends, whom you do
so much prize, among your lady visitors. You and I agree
in one thing at least, that a true and noble-souled woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
is worth a thousand of the average standard; and it is
something to be able to appreciate and love such a character.
Do you not think so?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac and Amy received your letter to them to-day and
sent it to me to read.</p>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cincinnati</span>, June 14, 1852.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Miss Catherine Fox and Sisters</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Permit me to offer a few thoughts in reference to
your late visit to the Queen City. Having spent the day
in calling on a number of the friends who visited you
while here, I find but one opinion, and that of regret at
the necessity of your having to leave so soon. I have just
left the Walnut Street House. The captain informs me
that no less than fifty persons had called to see you during
the day. He said, &lsquo;They came by carriage loads.&rsquo; Your
friend Sweeney, the proprietor, is on the anxious-seat.
The Spirit told him that a sister of his, residing in Texas,
was dead. He received a letter this morning, after you
left, conveying the sad intelligence of the death of that
sister. I think he may be classed as a convert to the
cause. I can but think that, had you remained another
week, the receipts would have doubled. The friends feel
that to wait till September is out of the question. Do
prevail on one of your sisters, Mrs. Fish, Margaretta, or
Mrs. Smith, to return with you immediately. Will not
the good Spirits approve of it? It does seem to me that
Cincinnati is the best point in the West, both in a pecuniary
point of view and for the advancement of the cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Miss Cronk, of Painesville, and her father, are expected
here soon, the circle having written and received an answer
that they would come. Should they come, it will be
for the benefit of the circle, and cannot interfere with your
visit. My Spiritual friends are all telegraphing me while
writing, in approbation, perhaps, of what I am saying. I
forgot to give you the book containing the list of the
names of the visitors. I will copy it and enclose it to you.
Please advise your sisters, and believe me</p>

<span class="smcap">Pacific Ocean</span>, June 21, 1852. Lat. 22 N., Long. 118 W.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My association with your family, during the past
summer and winter, I trust is a sufficient apology for the
liberty I take in addressing you. The past three months
have offered a good time for reflection, and I acknowledge
to a feeling of solicitude for you all. I know you have
friends in all parts of the world, but, I am sorry to say,
even some of your best friends sometimes fail to appreciate
the severe tests through which you are compelled to
pass, in order to prove the genuineness of Spirit manifestations.
You will oblige me very much if you will write
me particulars in regard to your success in your new home,
surrounded by new friends, etc., etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greeley expressed a hope that you would stop at
his home until your house is settled and ready for occupation.
He also expects that Katy will accept his invitation
to come immediately to attend school, and remain with
them until you are settled in New York. It is only since
my sea-life that I have fully realized the situation. You
are exposed to the scoffs and ridicule of the masses, at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
times and in all places. This great and important truth is
destined to revolutionize the world, and will render your
names a part of the history of the age. It has already
done so. I shall claim as a right from you, occasionally,
a full account of the progress of the cause. The subject
has been a very dear one to me. In fact, I feel that I am
living in a different sphere since I have been acquainted
with the object of my own existence, and have a clearer
perception of a life beyond. I can realize the truth of
that saying, so common with the good old Methodists,
viz., &lsquo;I enjoy a peace that the world cannot give nor take
away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are now almost one thousand miles from San
Francisco, being only four or five days&rsquo; sail, with a fair
wind. Unfortunately, however, the wind is turned unfavorable,
and we may be as many weeks. This is our
one hundred and fourth day at sea, without landing, having
travelled some fifteen thousand miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our voyage, on the whole, has been very pleasant.
The weather has been remarkably fine. We have not experienced
one day of what the sailors term rough weather.
Our passage round Cape Horn, the place so much dreaded
by all voyagers, was unusually favorable. We were only
three days in getting round, while it is common for ships
to be from fifteen to thirty. The greatest treat of the
voyage is the sunsets on this side. Their wondrous beauties
baffle every attempt at description. Will you have
the kindness to send by mail the piece of music, &lsquo;Haunted
Ground&rsquo;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;With kind regards to all, I remain yours truly,</p>

<h3>JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y.</span>, October 20, 1853.<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Leah</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have received your note of a recent date, and am
obliged to you for it, as I always am for a letter from you.
But, what is the matter with you? your letter is deeply
tinged with sadness, and reads very much as I feel sometimes,
though from a different cause from any which
appeared in yours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have, or had just then, a November mood on, and
here it is October, and a clear and bright sky; and although
it be autumn, it is one of no common beauty. What has
crossed your path? Are you not blessed with friends good
and true? such as you used to tell me of? and if your
health is passingly good, what is there standing between
you and your share of happiness? I suppose I might give
answers to these questions by looking in upon my own life
record: for a human is a human, and we are all of a piece
in most things. But your letter leads me to these questions,
and so my pen has asked them. You do not say a word
about Spirits, or what <em>they</em> and <em>you</em> are doing, leaving me to
guess everything which I would know about those things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You recollect Frederica Bremer paid you a visit on
Troup Street when she was in this country. Her manner
and remarks, as you related them to me, I remember in a
general way, particularly as she was, on account of her
eminent literary character, a marked personage; and I
was somewhat surprised this evening, when I read an extract
from her recent book of travels in America, in which
she gives an account of her interview with yourself and
sisters. It is evident that she was false to you, or else she
is <em>false to the public</em> who now read her work. I mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
this as a passing matter of but little consequence in itself,
disconnected with other considerations, but which are inseparable
therefrom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is, through her writings, the familiar and admired
companion in countless homes here and elsewhere; and
her opinions pass as of more value than those of most persons.
I regret exceedingly that, for some cause, she has
said either more or less than what seems to her the truth.
In the long run it will make no difference to truth itself,
but I do so hate to see one, whom I consider a noble
spirit, swerve a hair&rsquo;s breadth from the path of honor,
merely to minister to the current opinions of a world that
it should be too proud to bow to. It is but another instance,
another illustration of the truth of what I have
often said to you and our friend George Willets, that there
never has been anything which so severely tried the integrity
of men and women as does this Spiritualism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>The Rochester Union</cite> tells us you have quietly settled
down in a place called Harmony, Chautauqua Co.
No other paper has the news.</p>

<h3>GOVERNOR N. P. TALLMADGE.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fond du Lac, Wis.</span>, March 27, 1857.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Brown</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I received yesterday from Judge Smith the communication
through you from my wife deceased. It was remarkable
and significant in every point of view. Judge Smith
writes that her name was not known to him nor to you,
and he did not know whether it be right or wrong. I wish
to say to you, it is exactly right&mdash;both the Christian name
and the middle letter; and it is remarkable that whilst
Judge Smith spells my name, as almost all persons spell it,
with only one &lsquo;l,&rsquo; to wit <em>Tal</em>madge, the name as rapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
out, letter by letter, is <em>correctly</em> spelled with two &lsquo;l&rsquo;s,&rsquo; to
wit, Tallmadge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was much gratified with your note of condolence appended
to the communication. I know your sincerity, and
I appreciate your sympathy. You know the pain of separation,
and the severance of such earthly ties. But how my
views have changed from what they were when my son
William died! I had no peace for years till I began to
communicate with him through you. Death now has no
terrors for me. I feel that the separation from beloved
friends and relatives is but temporary&mdash;and that, by a pure
life here, we shall soon be again united in &lsquo;another and a better
world,&rsquo; where there will be no more separation forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With kindest regards to your mother and sisters, I remain,
very truly,</p>

<h3>PAULINE W. DAVIS.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Providence</span>, August 8, 1857.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs. B.</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;A writer, whom I have been recently reading, says:
&lsquo;I count life not by years but by the acquaintances I form
and value, hence if I make a love I double or even treble
that year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that sense I would like to be old, for I would like
to have many real loves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of my visit to New York, for I learned that
my heart was not cold when any one came near me with
the power to rouse me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deeply as I am interested in the new philosophy you
are a chosen teacher of, still I am more interested in you
as a woman; a woman whose heart is alive to all that is
good and great, and that has been purified by a high love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not often, as I told you, that I make any demonstrations
of affection (and I have been so long called cold
that I begin to think I am rather so). Nor do I often
express admiration; but toward you I was impelled to
offer much; and now, in writing you, were I to utter all
the warm feelings that awaken in my heart toward you, I
fear you might think me weak and enthusiastic&mdash;or worse,
insincere; which God forbid I should ever be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my opposite in almost everything. This may
account for my admiration, but not for my love; for it is
not every one that I can love. I have looked about to see
what I could do among my friends, and what inducement
I could offer you to come; which is very little indeed beyond
a warm welcome to our little cottage and hearts. Our
friends are nearly all absent, but some half-dozen gentlemen
wish much to have you come. So your expenses
would be insured, and you should have rest, quiet, and the
perfect protection of our house; and I think you would
enjoy the freshness of the country. It is so green and
lovely now that it seems like June. I have been in Boston
and saw my dear boy, who will come down to see you if
you come. I also obtained for you a beautiful thimble, so
do not bring one for yourself. Please let me hear from you
at once, and if you will come&mdash;what day. We will then
meet you with our carriage and take care of you. My
husband is greatly interested in my story, but can&rsquo;t realize
the truth in the least. [This refers to a remarkable cure
of Mrs. Davis by Mrs. B. which will be found in the
chapter on Spirit Cures, page <a href="#Page_364">364</a>.-<span class="smcap">-Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3>SAME.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Providence</span>, June 12, 1859.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Mrs. Underhill</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been waiting a long time, hoping to hear from
you and to have that visit appointed. Now the country
is so beautiful I must urge you to come and enjoy it with
me. Last evening I met Mr. Bartlett, who inquired for
you and hoped you would come very soon. He gives a
strawberry party on Saturday evening of this week. You
shall see just whom you would like to see, and no others.
You shall ride, walk, or rest, just as you like, and have a
good time, that shall make you forget all the disagreeables
of the past. How fortunate it is that we have the ability
to forget some things, and that the heart prefers to retain
the beautiful and cast aside the evil. Come next week, as
then I shall have strawberries in abundance and cherries
too. Mr. Underhill must come <em>for</em> you. If he comes
<em>with</em> you, he will hurry you away too soon, I know, and
there are a thousand things for us to talk about. My
little Maybell is in splendid health and spirits. Give my
kind regards to Mr. Underhill, and tell him to give you
leave of absence now. Let me hear from you soon. If
you come by the Fall River boat you have a beautiful sail
up the river, and be here to breakfast about half-past ten
o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will meet you with a carriage at the wharf.</p>

<h3>JOHN E. ROBINSON.</h3>

<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New York</span>, October 1, 1884.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Kind Friend, Mrs. Underhill</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learning that you are about having published a new
book on the general subject of Modern Spiritualism, and
that, in connection therewith, you propose to avail yourself
of such writings of mine as were suggested by a careful
study of its phenomenal facts during the early days of
their occurrence; I write now to say that, so far from
having any objections to such a design, I acquiesce promptly
and thoroughly in your request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, if any letters of mine, either of a public
or private character, can be of service to you, you need
not, as a suggestion of delicacy, withhold my name.
What is truth to me, I utter, if the occasion seems to call
for its expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has occurred to me, in this connection, that some
thoughts of my maturer years, which have quite recently
passed through my mind, may be pertinent to the general
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without being censorious, and desiring to keep strictly
within the bounds of propriety, allow me to say that I have
noted a marked tendency, especially in these latter years,
of a more general atheistic quality in public thought upon
the general subjects which lie at the base of all human religious
belief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might, perhaps, italicize what I refer to, as a near
approach to a positive unbelief, in most grades of modern
intellects; from the most gifted to those lower strata
which take their initial thoughts from their superiors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it seems to me on reflection, during a long season
when my thoughts have been almost my only companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
that the cause of all this general declension or &lsquo;eclipse of
faith&rsquo; is, that Science has taught too much, <em>unless it teaches
more</em>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather phrase it, however (for the emendation
is a better solution), that the true teachings of science have
not been followed out to their ultimates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, to my apprehension, this is a most grievous error,
and was well expressed by the poet who penned the lines,</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&lsquo;Oh, star-eyed Science! hast thou wandered there<br /><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring us back the tidings of Despair?&rsquo;<br /><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Science has, as I apprehend it&mdash;and I would not be erroneous
in my judgment, nor willingly harsh&mdash;generally
impressed the intellects of its votaries in such a manner
as to lead them intellectually to find <em>nothing beyond the
elemental matter of the Universe as their eyes behold it</em>.
Exceptions there have been, and are, to this general charge;
but they are rare. To refer in especial to the fact stated
(without being ungenerously personal), I may add that the
acknowledged highest and most accomplished medical authority
in New York to-day (so I am informed) hesitates
not to aver, as his best and highest conviction, that when
a human body is thoroughly dissected upon his table, he
has shown to his class of students all <em>that was or is</em> of the
specimen of humanity, save the extinct principle of animal
existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is simply bald, blank atheism!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an undoubted fact that such an opinion <em>may be held</em>
by many a man of sincerity; but such products have been
initiated by the gross sensuousness of the religious thought,
that has given <em>form and substance</em> to what should never
have been considered as coming within the range of things
designated by and possessing those attributes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me explain, if I can, to the comprehension of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
as may, perchance, read this, the nature of the Faith that
is in me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am willing in my elder days to live by it, and to be
judged of it by the enlightened convictions of my fellow-men
while I live upon this earth, and by that Deity in
whom I verily believe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;we all know&mdash;of the imperious forces of nature
which rock a continent or roll back an ocean from
its shores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We also know something of gigantic and of microscopic
life; of the intelligence of animated nature, through all
its varied and wonderful forms; we know and study the
wonders of the human intellect, even from (I might almost
say) the first dawn of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all, more or less, conversant with the action of
principles which inhere in many species of vegetable life,
in which we note a rare and exquisite faculty of sensation,
which mirrors in its perfection the faculty of human consciousness,
and human ingenuity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We look, not upward nor downward&mdash;for those terms
are inadmissible in this connection&mdash;but outward from our
standpoint; and what do we see? The heavens, as the
ancients called what their limited vision revealed to them.
Under Galileo&rsquo;s lead we look again, aided by the telescope
of moderate power, and, beyond that gathered in our first
field of sight, we find another countless host of stars. Tired
with the result we think and rest. Recuperating our
wearied eyes, we substitute an instrument of higher power,
and again peer into the realm of Infinitude. And again
another congeries of stars is opened to our human vision.
Repeat the process as we may, and as often as we choose,
increase the penetrating power of our instrument, the same
fact remains. There is no end, no limitation. But in all
these results of our inquisitorial efforts we discover one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
preponderating law&mdash;that of undeviating order. This is the
one omnipresent principle by which their movements are
governed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law, in this sense at least, must be and is the result of
dictation by the highest wisdom, and necessitates the existence
of Deity. I use the term because it is the only one
which is pertinent to the subject and idea to be expressed.
The word God is the outcome of the earlier ages of comparative
intellectual darkness. The highest mental status
of mankind at that time could not apprehend a Ruler of
the Universe except as clothed with a form somewhat analogous
to that of a human being, and hence the rather
presumptuous declaration that &lsquo;God created man in His
own image.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can readily apprehend this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, on contemplation, we look the <em>august question</em>
squarely in the face, we can most certainly reach the conclusion
that this Ideal is the highest possible one, and
centres within itself <em>all things else</em> requisite to an intelligent
apprehension of what we are striving to reach. To
illustrate&mdash;if we have not already covered the basic ground
of the thought&mdash;all the most potent and irresistible forces
of Nature are strictly impalpable; and yet we know somewhat
of their lurkings; and such star-eyed minds as that
of a Morse can reverently and gently lead them in the direction
of human pathways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This conviction may be considered as the final result
of the eager inquiry of honest and intelligent human
minds. I think it the reflex of the conviction of England&rsquo;s
Newton, and I accept and retain it as a finality of
the question. It ennobles instead of dwarfing one&rsquo;s conception
of a Ruler of all things, and gives us a stable as well
as a rational and intellectual standpoint of observation, of
faith, and of love. Higher than the God of earlier worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
because entirely removed from the sensuous perceptions;
not fashioned after the crude and dimly visioned
ideals of elder time, it is sufficient for the highest yearnings
of all Humanity, and must necessarily ennoble the
faith of all with whom it shall live as the great exponent
of Power, Truth, and Love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remain, sincerely, as ever,</p>

<p>The following letter will explain itself. Professor J.
Jay Watson needs no description. He was an intimate
friend of Olé Bull, who bequeathed to him his favorite
violin, on which instrument he is himself a consummate
performer, while his little son, Emmons Watson, bids fair
some day to rival Olé Bull himself. His direction of the
music at the Centennial of 1876, and his popular &ldquo;dime
concerts&rdquo; in New York, attended by some hundreds of
thousands, have made Professor Watson not less widely
known than he is everywhere highly respected, for his
philanthropy as well as musical genius and powers.<br />
<span class="sign2">A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;U.</span><br /></p>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. A. Leah Underhill</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Highly Esteemed Friend</span>&mdash;It is with unfeigned
pleasure that I comply with your request to furnish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
with an account of my strange experience while visiting
San Francisco, Cal., in company with Olé Bull, the violinist,
in 1870.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cheerfully give the facts as they occurred, and it seems
eminently proper that the incident which I am about to
relate should occupy a place in your forthcoming book,
when we recollect that the problem involved was solved
through your marvellous mediumistic powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father-in-law, Mr. Samuel Parsons, formerly an
old and revered citizen of Gloucester, Mass., and who
passed to the life beyond in 1865, had for many years been
noted for his remarkable prophecies as to the coming of
future events, as well as a strict regard for honesty and
truth. We frequently talked of the change called death,
and as we were both somewhat materialistic in our views
as to a future state of existence, we mutually agreed that
the one who should be first called to pay the debt of nature,
would, if there was a possibility of Spirit return, with sufficient
power to tangibly manifest his presence, surely do
so; and in order that there could be no mistaking the individual
identity, he would seize the one still in earth-life
by the hair of his head and forcibly pull him from his bed
to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laughable, and even ridiculous, as it may seem, this
promise was at various times renewed, and frequently in
the presence of mutual friends, who are still living. This
agreement was made as a sort of harmless joke, neither
Mr. Parsons nor myself having, up to this time, investigated
the philosophy of Modern Spiritualism in any form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During my visit to San Francisco, Cal., while managing
the &lsquo;Olé Bull Concert Combination,&rsquo; I had occasion
to employ a number of persons, one of whom, having been
proved glaringly dishonest, I was obliged to discharge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This individual, not being satisfied with my leniency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
in letting him off without legal punishment, vowed vengeance
upon me, saying to several persons that I should
&lsquo;<em>never leave California alive</em>.&rsquo; As &lsquo;barking dogs seldom
bite,&rsquo; I paid little attention to his threats. One evening,
after the conclusion of our concert, I was accompanied to
my hotel by J. Heneage Carter, Esq., an old-time friend,
and the originator of the once famous &lsquo;Carter Zouave
Troupe.&rsquo; After depositing the receipts of the evening with
Mr. Ridgeway, clerk of the &lsquo;Lick House,&rsquo; where our company
were stopping, I retired to my room with my friend
Carter. A brief chat ensued, no allusion whatever being
made as to the threats of the discharged employee. Mr.
Carter bade me a cheerful good-night and took his departure.
I had no special anxiety upon my mind, had
eaten no hearty supper, taken no beverage in the shape of
wine or liquor of any description; in fact, I have scrupulously
avoided dissipation in any form up to the present
moment of my life; consequently there was nothing in
my stomach calculated to induce nightmare or unpleasant
dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon retiring I immediately fell into a tranquil sleep,
from which I was unceremoniously awakened, without the
slightest warning, by being suddenly and vigorously
grasped, apparently by a strong hand, by the hair of my
head and jerked with tremendous force from my bed,
landing sprawling upon the floor. Immediately gaining
my feet, I prepared to face a demon in the flesh of some
sort, and groped about the room to find a friendly chair
with which to defend myself, if need be. No further
demonstration being made, however, I proceeded to strike
a light, nor for a moment did I lose my self-control, although
constantly expecting to be attacked by some unseen
foe. Upon carefully examining my room there was not
the slightest sign of any being, human or otherwise, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the exception of myself. Everything was still and as
usual. I looked at my watch and found the time to be
5.40 <span class="lower">A.M.</span> My scalp smarted intensely, as it naturally
would after such harsh treatment, and had I been near an
Indian camp I could readily have believed that I had lost
that important appendage, and without any great stretch
of the imagination either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As there is no effect without a cause, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>,
I soon seated myself and endeavored to solve the meaning
of the remarkable phenomenon just experienced. In a
moment a terrible thought flashed upon my mind. Perhaps
some member of my family or near relative had died
suddenly. Hastily making my toilet I proceeded to the
nearest telegraph station and impatiently awaited the
arrival of the operator. My despatch was directed to my
sister in New York, with whom my family were stopping
at the time, and simply read, &lsquo;<i>How are you all? Answer.</i>&rsquo;
The reply, &lsquo;<i>All well</i>,&rsquo; caused me to breathe more freely,
but the mystery was yet unexplained. I told the story to
my friend Olé Bull, who became intensely interested,
and often during our stay in California expressed a great
deal of solicitude in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would here state <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>, that the agreement
made by my wife&rsquo;s father and myself did not recur to my
mind. To be sure, Mr. Parsons had been dead more than
five years, yet it seems to me quite remarkable that our
old compact had not at once presented itself; but I felt
convinced that this singular demonstration <em>meant</em> something.
Upon my return to New York I visited you in
company with Olé Bull, and you kindly gave us a private
sitting. The alphabet being called for, the following was
rapped out: &lsquo;<i>John, the man whom you discharged in San
Francisco, was on the veranda of the hotel, and determined
to execute his terrible threat. I thought it a good time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
redeem my promise, and pulled you out of bed by your
hair. I was obliged to do this roughly in order to thoroughly
awaken you.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Samuel Parsons.</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2d">&ldquo;With great respect I am</span><br />
<span class="sign2b">&ldquo;Your sincere friend,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MEDIUMSHIP.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Mysteries of Mediumship&mdash;To Prove the Immortality of the
Soul&mdash;Passivity and Harmony at Séances&mdash;Honest and
Candid Scepticism&mdash;Imaginary and Self-induced Mediumship&mdash;Deceptive
Communications&mdash;Cautions&mdash;Rappings&mdash;Spirits
made Visible&mdash;Beware of Fraudulent Mediums&mdash;Not
All Spirits Reliable&mdash;Cabinets.</p>


<p>Mediumship is a great mystery. Some persons are found
to possess the gift (often from ancestral derivation, as in
the case of the &ldquo;second-sight&rdquo; in the Scotch Highlands),
while others are totally devoid of it. There are also many
varieties both in the forms and phases of it, and in the degrees
in which different persons possess the strange&mdash;I may
say, abnormal&mdash;gift. There seem to be also great variations
of <em>degree</em> in which it is possessed by different persons, constituting
differences of mediumistic power.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that there are few families in which some
one or other of its members does not possess it, at least in
latent condition, more or less developed or undeveloped;
and that, if they will sit patiently and <em>passively</em> (without
anxiety or eagerness) round a table, without being discouraged
and exhausted of patience by weeks or even months
of failure, the manifestations will generally at last come,
whether in the form of rappings, or that of tilting of the
table, or in other phenomena inexplicable on the ground
of the ordinary laws of physical nature, and compelling
the recognition of the presence of extra-natural beings or
forces&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Spirits&rdquo;&mdash;as the only explanation of the
manifest and incontestable facts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, apart from the various degrees of the faculty in
the mediums, there is mystery hanging over the question
of the various degrees of ability of Spirits who may be
present&mdash;high, low, or of intermediate grade and character&mdash;to
act through or with a particular medium. And still
again, there is mystery over the influence of the members
of the circle present, both upon the sensitive medium and
upon the Spirits present. And upon the fundamental
point of what constitutes mediumship, on what qualities,
physical, mental or spiritual, it depends, hangs the greatest
mystery of all.</p>

<p>One thing seems certain, namely, that at least in the
present age or &ldquo;dispensation,&rdquo; the Spirits about us seem
desirous of communicating with us, human Spirits still in
the flesh, and glad of the opportunities afforded them
through the mediums for doing so. &ldquo;Psychics,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sensitives,&rdquo;
have been suggested as more suitable designations
than &ldquo;mediums,&rdquo; but that of &ldquo;medium&rdquo; seems to have
got too strongly rooted in popular usage to be now easily
changed.</p>

<p>It is certain that history shows what may be called
mediumship to have existed in all ages, climes, and civilizations,
in various degrees, and that in all races, barbarian
or civilized, there has been more or less of
manifestation, to man still in the flesh, of the continued
existence of disincarnated man, or Spirits. The extraordinary
outpouring of the evidence of this great truth which
our times have witnessed, and which, beginning in our
country, has so rapidly made the circuit of the globe, seems,
as has been declared by many of the higher classes of
Spirits, to have grown out of the fact, that the science and
philosophy of the century had become so deeply imbued
with <em>materialism</em>, fast sapping the foundations of <em>all</em> religion,
that it had become necessary, in the counsels of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
high Spirits who are the ministers of the will of the Infinite
Supreme we name God, to overpour the world
with a new flood of irresistible demonstration of the truth
and reality of the next life and of the immortality of the
soul.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is one mental condition, on the part of mediums
and sitters, more constantly insisted upon by good Spirits
as necessary toward the attaining of good results in the
manifestations, it is that of &ldquo;<em>passivity</em>.&rdquo; If a sitter earnestly
desires a particular thing, has his heart and thought and
will strongly set upon it, that is precisely what he is least
likely to obtain, or to obtain it clearly and satisfactorily, if
he obtain it at all. The expression is sometimes used that
both medium and sitter must keep themselves in a <em>negative</em>,
as distinguished from a <em>positive</em>, condition. If they are
&ldquo;positive&rdquo;&mdash;especially if persons of strong will&mdash;their magnetic
or Spiritual &ldquo;positiveness&rdquo; seems to work adversely
instead of harmoniously with that of the invisibles.</p>

<p>The testimony from the Spirits is pretty unanimous that
tranquil mental harmony in the circle is very necessary
toward the attainment of good results. Discussion of subjects
of difference, in however friendly a temper it may
be conducted, is unfavorable. This is generally accepted
as the reason why instrumental or vocal music is so commonly
resorted to, as tending to lead the minds of all into
the same channel. There may also be something in its
action to attune the air-vibrations into accord instead of
opposition, resulting from the differences of voice among a
number of persons thus gathered together.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that faith in Spiritualism on
the part of all present is a necessary condition of success
at séances. It is true that it sometimes seems that the
presence of particular individuals is fatal to any, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
but the feeblest, manifestations. In such cases it is not
their ignorance and disbelief, nor a rational scepticism, that
militate against success. On the contrary, Spirits like the
visits of honest, candid sceptics or inquirers, who are not
inaccessible to evidence, nor so resolutely and bitterly hostile,
and so acrid in temper, that they neither can be convinced
though one &ldquo;rose from the dead,&rdquo; nor are worthy
of the attempt. They seem to resent the insulting presence
and the unworthy mental condition and attitude of
such persons, and ill-disposed to cast such pearls before
such swine. Also, when sitters come with lies and fraud
in their hearts, and trickery in their purposes, they bring
with or attract to them lying and fraudulent Spirits who
like to give them just what they come to seek. It is perhaps
even more true in the Spirit life than in this, that
like attracts like, and that birds of a feather flock together.</p>

<p>There are many imaginary mediums. They will tell
you they see, hear, and speak to you under the influence of
Spirits, when it is nothing but an emanation from their
own brain, and perhaps from the forces of the circle combined.
This I believe to be a self-induced condition, developed
by the powerful influence of the human will acting
upon their own physical force.</p>

<p>Beware how you become ensnared in the meshes of such
mediums. They are only fit subjects for the lunatic asylums.</p>

<p>There are, I believe, some unexplored regions in the
human brain which may be hereafter explained and better
understood.</p>

<p>I will give you an example of this phase of mediumship.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, an excellent man but very ambitious
to excel in doing good, and at the same time to take a high
position in Spiritualism, was told by Spirits that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
be a medium. He was very sanguine and believed that
he could revolutionize the world, if he should become
one.</p>

<p>He was a clergyman and an honest man. One morning
(after having waited a long time for the fulfilment of the
promise that he would be a medium), he came to me with
a roll of paper in his hand, his face beaming with joy,
saying as he entered the room, &ldquo;At last the prophecy has
been fulfilled! See, listen,&rdquo; and he read a beautiful poem
signed &ldquo;Felicia Hemans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He afterward wrote many interesting things, and I have
no doubt there were or had been times when he was under
the influence of good Spirits; but as soon as he became
ambitious to set himself up as &ldquo;high priest,&rdquo; that innate
something which belongs to the natural man performed
the office of his own mind.</p>

<p>That development is often very disastrous and unreliable,
and should not be encouraged. I will give you an illustration
in the following communication.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, while sitting in his library, his
hand was influenced to write a communication, of which
the following is a copy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I departed this earth-life a few hours ago, in&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;
Street, No.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;. You will find my children mourning
over my lifeless form. Go to them at once and assist
them to bury my body.<br />
<span class="sign2">(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<p>He read the communication to his wife, who remonstrated,
saying that she doubted it; but after considering
the matter they both started to find the distressed family.
It was not very far from them; but judge of their astonishment
when they found no such place as had been mentioned.
The <em>street</em> was there, but no <em>house</em>, and no number
like the place designated. The communication, in its
essentials, was <em>an entire fabrication</em>. In the evening they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
both called on me, and desired, if possible, that Spirits
would explain through the rappings why he should have
been so deceived. The rapping said, &ldquo;My dear friend,
this is an experience which you will not forget. You
have been led by ambition, mistaking it for a higher
motive. You have besought Spirits to direct you, when
you should have acted according to your own best judgment.
Thus you have attracted a class of Spirits who are
unreliable.&rdquo; This was something which many were necessitated
to learn in the school of experience, especially in
those early days of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>I do not approve of sitting in promiscuous circles for
development. I remember several years ago there was a
circle held in New York for the purpose of making mediums.
Our friend, Mr. George Willets, visited the rooms
of the &ldquo;developers&rdquo; several times, and reported to us the
unfavorable effect it produced upon him. My sister Katie
on one occasion went with him. When she returned she
felt badly and complained of strange sensations, caused
(she believed) by sitting in that circle. It affected her unfavorably
for some days. She was sad, and complained of
seeing disagreeable things whenever her eyes closed. This
gradually changed, but she could never be persuaded to
visit such circles again.</p>

<p>In the case of the Dr. Phelps&rsquo;s manifestations I think
there was abundant evidence to prove that a natural development
took place there. And I am sure that we
fought against it long enough and hard enough to prove
that we were not knowingly instrumental in bringing
about anything of our own mediumship. We were all
annoyed at the idea of being called mediums.</p>

<p>Another well-known case&mdash;were I to mention the name
it would be clearly remembered&mdash;was that of a wealthy gentleman
doing a large business in this city. He came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
see me at No. 1 Ludlow Place, rejoicing in his newly developed
mediumship. He was a large, finely organized
man, and came to explain to me how wonderfully he was
affected. He told me that his wife was not pleased because
he sat in circles for development, and she thought
he was losing his mind. This gentleman lived in Brooklyn,
and if this should come under his eye he will recollect
the circumstance. He was not a disciple of the
&ldquo;Rochester knockings,&rdquo; but a professed admirer of speaking,
writing, and impressible mediums. He thought it
would be very fine to become a great public speaker (as
he had been told he would be), and astonish the world;
and therefore he believed it. He soon began to whirl
around and pound himself and snort like an animal. I
thought he was a raving madman; but when he spoke he
seemed rational enough at times, but his lucid moments
were few and far between.</p>

<p>At length the Spirit rapped out the following: &ldquo;My
son, sit down at the table.&rdquo; He did so, apparently delighted.
Again the alphabet was called for, and this was
spelled: &ldquo;Enclose the extremities of your fingers within
your hands, cross your feet and rest your heels on the floor,
and permit me to give you advice, namely: When you sit
in the circle, exerting every faculty of mind and body,
with your hands on the table and your feet on the floor,
all your brain forces escape through your extremities and
are absorbed by the more receptive members of the circle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed the directions of his guardian Spirit, and
became quiet, and was so deeply interested in the rappings
that he engaged a private hour and brought his wife the
next day, who became equally interested and honestly confessed
to me that she had blamed and condemned me as
an impostor; and although her husband had not met in
my circles, she charged me with being the original cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
of her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;misfortune&rdquo;&mdash;as she considered it.
From that time he was cured.</p>

<p>I think he was on the high road to the lunatic asylum;
and, although some writers term the Spirit-rapping a
manifestation of &ldquo;lower grade,&rdquo; in my own opinion communications
come more direct from Spirits through the
rappings, or when accompanied by them, than when written
or spoken, etc., in magnetic circles where the mediums are
quite as susceptible to an action exerted upon them by
Spirits <em>embodied</em> as by the <em>disembodied</em>.</p>

<p>I have found it so in my own experience, and I never
place entire confidence in anything unless the Spirits sanction
it to me by sounds in connection with the alphabet,
which was their first chosen method with us. Nor do I
rely on the rappings unless what is said through them
bears in itself the evidence of truth. I regret to see persons
too much carried away by this or any <em>ism</em>. Give me
a good amanuensis, one who can take down each letter as
it is indicated (and not interrupt me by asking very often,
&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; which breaks the telegraphic connection,
for the time, through which Spirits operate, exactly
as the telegraphic wires are affected by a thunder-storm)&mdash;give
me, I say, such an amanuensis, and I can sit, as I
have often sat, for hours at a time, receiving the letters
through the raps and alphabet, with no idea of their connection
or meaning, nor any such knowledge possible to
any listener, and at the close every letter, word, and sentence
will be found perfectly correct, and the whole intelligible
only when the whole is read in connected sequence.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any mortal to sit and reiterate the
letters of the alphabet as fast as they can be repeated, hour
after hour, and retain in the mind the structure of the
sentences and chapters communicated. I defy any one to
do it. Even Theodore Parker pronounced it a quietus on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the Buffalo doctors. Try it yourselves, dear readers.
Under the right conditions, I can sit and call the letters
for hours together, and when the message is finished it
will be found to be perfect and unbroken from beginning
to end&mdash;in accordance with the intelligence of the Spirit,
not that of the medium.</p>

<p>I have seen Spirits walk around the room, furnishing
their own light sufficiently bright to show themselves distinctly
to all persons present, when every precaution had
been taken to lock and seal the doors and windows, to prevent
ingress or egress of any person to disturb the circle;
and I know hundreds, still living, who can testify to this
statement.</p>

<p>Now, then, why should there be any need of so conducting
circles for manifestations as to cause suspicion, or leave
the minds of investigators in doubt? Should a medium be
allowed to enter a cabinet without any precautions on the
part of the sitters to require &ldquo;test conditions,&rdquo; and deliberately
clothe him or herself in the habiliments of angels,
and then softly glide forth into a dimly lighted room,
scarcely visible to the eye, and call it a &ldquo;materialization&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;transfiguration&rdquo;? Shame on such cruel deception.
I am astonished that people are willing to be so imposed
upon. When I was before the public, I expected and
wished to give every satisfaction in my power. I believe
all persons who wish to know the truth, and are willing to
pay mediums for their time and trouble, should demand
their rights, search the cabinets, and hold the mediums by
joining hands until they are fully satisfied of the truthfulness
of the manifestations. We have never objected to
being held, and we have even submitted to being stethoscoped
and gagged to settle the question of ventriloquism,
after every other test had been applied.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be understood as condemning all cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
séances. We, for our part, never used cabinets nor
had occasion to do so. I know, through the best of testimony,
that with honest mediums and select confidential
circles, marvellous phenomena have taken place through
that means since my day. But I do disapprove of such
séances before promiscuous parties, when not accompanied
with precautions against the possibility of deception; for
when &ldquo;test conditions&rdquo; are not required by the sitters, or
insisted upon by the mediums as their only protection
against malevolent suspicions, they open the door to fraudulent
mediums for the practice of abominable deceptions.</p>

<p>Nor will I dismiss the subject without cautioning all
against the error of always relying implicitly upon the
communications of those whom they regard as Spirits far
better, higher, and more enlightened than themselves or
their friends. Still less should they, necessarily, obey their
directions or counsels, especially in regard to their business
or social concerns.</p>

<p>Many investigators find it hard to divest themselves of
a sort of superstitious reverence for the Spirits in conversation
with them. It is a mistake to suppose them to know
everything, and a greater one to imagine them capable of
doing everything. It is sometimes an error even to believe
them to be the Spirits they profess to be. Spirits are of
many varieties of condition, character, and degrees of
progress. There are those prone to amuse themselves
with a sort of practical joking and false personation; and
such Spirits, being in a low plane, are apt to be glad of
any opportunity to push themselves forward into the door
opened by the presence of the medium, and play their
fantastic tricks on the too credulous. We must judge for
ourselves of the reasonableness, the probability, and the
characteristic resemblance of what Spirits may say, to that
which we might have expected from them. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
strive, by our daily lives and conversation, to attract to
ourselves only Spirits of the better and higher orders in
that world of the next life, which is far more densely populous
than the one in which we ourselves still &ldquo;live and
move and have our being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time I think that the cause of Spiritualism
would be at this day further advanced in general acceptance,
if cabinets, and with them the phenomena called
materialization and transfiguration, had never been introduced.
For, however genuine, as well as impressive, may
be the manifestations of the presence and action of the
Spirits which may have occurred in the employment of
them, they afford <em>opportunities</em> for deception which dishonest
mediums are but too ready to avail themselves of, and
then when exposure comes (and it is generally Spiritualists
who are the most earnest in detecting and punishing the
infamy of such deception), they are at once trumpeted all
over the land, and more harm is done to the progress of the
cause than all the good ever resulting from the genuine phenomena
themselves. No such exposures ever occurred in
all our long and varied experience, though never have mediums
been subjected to more jealous and severe investigations;
and there are few of the more modern phenomena
which have not occurred through our mediumship, though
the usual mode of communication practised at our circles
was the one which I still consider the best and most direct,
as it is the simplest&mdash;that of rapping to the alphabet.</p>

<p>I will only add, before dismissing the subject, that
though it is so many years since I have ceased to practise
the public exercise of my mediumship, I am not conscious
that it has at all weakened or changed. On rare occasions
I have given private sittings to confidential friends, and
few days pass which do not bring me conscious evidence of
the presence of Spirit friends. It was under their prompting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
and indeed direction, that I have written this book,
and often during its progress have they given me their
counsel at moments of doubt on my part as to what to insert
or to omit. Happy, in so many ways, as has been my domestic
life, I should be ungrateful if I did not realize how
largely the unseen friends and visitors of my home have
contributed to that happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">MISCELLANEOUS INCIDENTS.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt2">Felicia Hemans&mdash;Spirit Dictations of Music.</p>


<p>In compliance with the advice and wishes of the friend
who has aided me in putting together the scattered parts
of my volume, I now proceed to wind it up with what I
might call a sample assortment of &ldquo;Incidents&rdquo; out of my
Spiritualistic experience. This was not within my original
scheme of the work, but in the course of several
months of intimate intercourse with him, there naturally
arose in conversation frequent allusions to such reminiscences,
leading me to tell him, under his intelligent interrogation,
the story of them. The result was that he came
to insist that some collection of them would constitute a
useful as well as interesting addition to my &ldquo;Missing
Link.&rdquo; He therefore embraced many opportunities of returning
to them, and drawing from me repetitions of the
narratives, and jotting down notes, from which he then insisted
that I should write them out, with a little kind assistance
from him. This collection might easily have been
greatly enlarged.</p>


<h3>FELICIA HEMANS&mdash;SPIRIT DICTATION OF MUSIC.</h3>

<p>The following is a beautiful and curious experience
which came one evening at Rochester, in the early days
of our mediumship:</p>

<p>Maggie and I were sitting alone in my cozy little parlor
in Troup Street, enjoying ourselves by a warm fire while
the pouring rain and howling winds outside assured us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
that we should not be interrupted by callers. I was reading
&ldquo;Memoirs of the Wesley Family,&rdquo; when the alphabet
was called for by the usual signal. I repeated the letters
as they came through the alphabet, and wrote them as
designated successively by the Spirit, viz.:</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;GAGCBAGAGEFEFAGFEFGFEDAGGCEDGGCB<br />
AGCCDBC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These letters could not, of course, be construed into
words, and I cast them aside saying, &ldquo;This must be the
Spirit of Johnny Story,&rdquo; a simple boy whom we had known
when living, who could never be taught to read. The alphabet
was again called for and the message given by the
Spirit was, &ldquo;Apply the letters to your piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On doing so I recognized in them, to my surprise and
delight, a sweet and tender melody. I was then told to
set the music to &ldquo;Haunted Ground&rdquo; in Mrs. Hemans&rsquo;s
Poems, but with the variation of changing &ldquo;Haunted&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Hallowed&rdquo; in the last verse.</p>

<p>Professor J.&nbsp;J. Watson has kindly arranged the accompaniment
for the organ and piano, as on the next page.</p>

<p>I have always considered this one of the most beautiful
and interesting tests I have ever received. It certainly
was not mind-reading. The letters as given had of course
conveyed no sense to me, nor any idea of musical notes.
In connection with the music thus given for the poem with
its altered name, I presume that it is proper to reproduce
the poem itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">MISCELLANEOUS INCIDENTS (<i>Continued</i>).</span></h2>

<p class="sbt">Crowd of Spirits made Visible by Lightning&mdash;Scarcely Credible
but True&mdash;A Game of Euchre&mdash;Margaret&rsquo;s Dream&mdash;Mistaken
Names Corrected by Spirits&mdash;An Unwilling Convert
made Grateful and Happy.</p>


<h3>CROWD OF SPIRITS MADE VISIBLE BY LIGHTNING.</h3>

<p>One Sunday evening, in Ludlow Place, occurred the grandest
manifestations of Spirit presence I ever witnessed
or heard of. Our good friend Dr. A.&nbsp;D. Wilson and his
friend Dr. Kirby had come in the Doctor&rsquo;s carriage; and,
as a great thunder-storm was gathering fast overhead, he
ordered the carriage home, to return at nine o&rsquo;clock, or
when the storm should be over. We sat round the table
in my private room on the second floor, four of us&mdash;the
two gentlemen, mother, and myself. Soon the vivid lightning
flashed and the near thunder rolled and rattled overhead:
while in the intervals the blackest of darkness was
around us, the Spirits having directed us not to have lights.
The &ldquo;raps&rdquo; bade us to sing: and, my mother leading, we
sang the Methodist hymn: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pilgrim; I&rsquo;m a stranger,&rdquo;
etc. (my father and mother were Methodists). But as
the peals and flashes came so mightily I was afraid, and
thought it unseemly for us to sing in the presence of these
grand manifestations of the lights and the voices of the
heavens. Presently Dr. Wilson started up with the exclamation,
&ldquo;Oh my God! there&rsquo;s my mother,&rdquo; and we
all saw a form in the doorway leading from our room to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
another in the rear. And then, to his friend Dr. Kirby,
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s your mother with her arms around your
neck!&rdquo; And then again to my mother, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fox,
there&rsquo;s your noble father by you!&rdquo; And we all saw <em>the
Spirits</em>.</p>

<p>The whole room was crowded with a glorious company
of Spirits!</p>

<p>We would see them only by the flashes of the lightning.
When the flash had vanished, all was blackness; but, on
its return, there they were still, different forms and with
varying features; and they looked as natural as when in
this&mdash;our life. What were our feelings? How could I
express, or who will need that I should attempt to do so?
We all responded deeply to Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s exclamation, &ldquo;I
would not have missed this for all the world! Oh, who
after such a sight could ever again commit a sin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would seem that while we had no Spiritual sight to
see them clairvoyantly in the darkness, they could bear the
electric brightness of the lightning which revealed them to
our eyes.</p>

<p>A deep awe rested on us all, and we all united in the
following beautiful old Methodist hymn which my mother
sang. Many a time afterward we have sat in the hope of
a repetition of this glorious spectacle; and Dr. Wilson
would come when there seemed some prospect of thunder
and lightning. But it never came again. Perhaps there
was something in the quiet solemnity of that Sabbath hour
which prompted it to the Spirits; and once shown, it was
enough: for memory could not but keep it ever fresh in
our minds, as it is and will forever remain in mine.</p>

<h3>SCARCELY CREDIBLE, BUT TRUE.</h3>

<p>A strange adventure befell me, at the age of between
eight and nine years, which has always left a vivid impression
on my mind; and I cannot resist the prompting to
insert here a short summary of it. I will leave my readers
to judge of it for themselves.</p>

<p>I had obtained grandmother&rsquo;s permission to visit some
little girls at the house of their father, Mr. Cox; which
was granted on condition that I should be sure to come
home before nightfall.</p>

<p>It was about a mile and a half distant from home by the
main road, though less than a mile through the woods.
Much of that part of the country was at that time uncultivated
and abounded with wild beasts of every description
of the period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>I got safely to Mr. C.&rsquo;s; and had a day so happy that it
was only the threatening clouds of an approaching storm
which warned me that it was high time to start for home.
I set out by the roadway, but Mrs. Cox called me back
and sent two of her daughters to escort me through the
woods by the shorter paths, familiar to them on their way
to school. We had gone about half the distance through
the woods, when sharp lightning and heavy thunder announced
that the storm was close at hand; and the children
left me at a point from which, as they supposed, I
could not miss my further way. They gave me directions
how to proceed. I followed them, as I supposed; but the
darkness soon became intense, and the storm burst in all
its fury. The thunder and lightning were terrific, the
rain fell in torrents, and I was a very little girl alone in
the woods. I heard the distant cries of the inhabitants of
the wilderness, and hurriedly pressed forward in the hope
of following the right track, but constantly changing my
idea of which direction to take. After long wanderings
in this way, I fancied it to be about midnight, when the
howling of the winds rose to be nearly that of a tornado,
and the crashing of falling trees, torn up by the roots,
seemed to surround me in all directions.</p>

<p>I had been twenty times on my knees, in childish prayer
to God to take me home; but perhaps God in heaven is
too abstract an idea to be realized by a child of that age,
and I would instinctively find myself addressing my great-grandfather,
who was the only person whose death I had
ever witnessed. I had known him to be good and kind.
He was a man of unusual stature and strength. Him I
could understand to be in heaven, and powerful to save
me. I remember I prayed with my eyes closed, fearing I
should behold some terrible phantom, for in our family experience
and tradition there had been many strange stories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>I wandered all through that terrible night, and only
rested on my knees, when praying to God and the angels
(especially him, my grandfather) to protect me. Storm-beaten
and drenched as I then was I sat down and cried
bitterly. Suddenly my attention was arrested by an unusual
sound, as of boughs breaking and twigs crackling.
I looked in the direction of the sound and saw, standing
high upon the trunk of a fallen tree, a large, good-natured
looking dog, which I supposed to be Mr. Cox&rsquo;s dog,
&ldquo;Rover.&rdquo; Immediately fear left me. I felt him to be
<em>rescue and safety</em>. I called to him, &ldquo;Rover, Rover!&rdquo; and
tried to get near him, but he turned from me leading the
way. I followed; he looking back frequently, as if to see
whether or not I followed him. After wandering some
time through zig-zag routes, he brought me to Deacon
Demarest&rsquo;s place, which I recognized, as the house had
recently been burned and I could not mistake it. At this
point he loitered a moment, and came so near me that I
reached out my hand to caress him, but could or did not
touch him, although he pressed against me palpably several
times.</p>

<p>He &ldquo;waggled himself&rdquo; so like a dog, and seemed so
kind to me that I became fondly attached to him. On I
went, following him through cross-lots and over fences,
startling the cattle to their feet, and causing a great jingling
of cowbells, never looking back, but intently following
the dog, fearing to lose sight of him for a moment, lest he
should leave me. At last we came to my home. The
house stood about a hundred feet from the road. There
were two gates of entrance to the door-yard or grounds:
one a foot-gate, the other for carriages, etc. I opened the
small gate and held it open, supposing the dog would pass
through it; but judge of my amazement to see him instead
of doing so, scale the great gate with a bound and meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
me face to face on the other side, but no longer a dog!
(Perhaps, at that instant, it was a fleeting vision of a dog,
but it is certain he disappeared and was no more seen),
while the noble form of my great-grandfather, with his
loving smile, for a moment stood before me at the gate,
by the early morning light. I gave a scream which brought
my grandfather from the house to the door, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Great God! the child has been out in the woods all
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was put to bed, from which I did not rise for a week.
At times it was feared that I never should rise from it,
such was the effect of the exposure, fatigue, and fright of
that terrible night. Mr. Redfield (mentioned on page <a href="#Page_8">8</a>, etc.)
had spent the evening and night at our house, and was
told how I had disobeyed my orders to return home before
dark, and that I was evidently detained at Mr. Cox&rsquo;s. He
said, before starting in the morning, that he would stop at
Mr. Cox&rsquo;s on his way to mill, and see about me. On his
informing Mr. Cox that I had not returned home, the
latter hastened to our house in great fright lest evil had
befallen me from the animals or other adventure of the
woods. He found me of course safe and asleep in my
grandmother&rsquo;s bed. He was a devout Methodist, and
knelt by my bedside and prayed over me with thanks to
God that I had been preserved through the terrors of that
night of storm in those wild woods, and, as I was told
afterward, sobs of all the female members of the family
accompanied his prayer.</p>

<p>There are many persons of the neighborhood still living
whose recollection can verify this story, and with whom it
it is talked over when we meet, such as Evander Smith,
John Onderdonk (a cousin of mine), Philip Demarest,
Albert Collins, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>


<h3>A GAME OF EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>Dr. A.&nbsp;D. Wilson, one of the most prominent physicians
of New York, was one of my dearest and best of friends.
He had once&mdash;before my marriage&mdash;had the experience of
playing a game of euchre (through me as medium) with
an old Spirit friend of his, who, when in the flesh had
been his frequent companion at the game. I do not recall
the particulars of that former game sufficiently to relate it
with accuracy; but one day Dr. Wilson was telling the
story to Mr. Underhill, who thereupon asked the Spirits if
they would play a game with him, which he was promised
should be done. This promise was made some three years
before its fulfilment came about, during which time Mr.
Underhill had frequently reminded the Spirits of their
unfulfilled promise. It was an interesting experience, and
I felt desirous of again witnessing it. One evening at
about eight o&rsquo;clock (it was in about 1862), our nephew C.
O. Smith (a lad who figures as Charlie in the sketch of
our Ohio campaign) was seated at one end of the table
studying his lessons under bright gaslight. My husband
and myself were the only other persons in the room&mdash;which
was the library, front room of the second story.
Mr. Underhill was reclining on the lounge, and I was
seated near the middle window. By a simultaneous impulse
(and such <em>simultaneous impulses</em> were a frequent experience
with us) my husband and myself started up and
seated ourselves at the table. I will continue the story as
I have it written by Mr. Underhill himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leah and myself sat opposite each other, Charlie being
seated at the end of the table between us, with his books.
I asked the Spirit once again if he would fulfil the promise
given long ago to play a game of cards, as was occasionally
done between Leah and myself. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rsquo; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
answered. I asked, &lsquo;Who is it? Will you give me your
name?&rsquo; The alphabet being then called for, the name
was given me privately, not by rapping, which Leah would
of course have heard, but by touches on my foot, in correspondence
to the letters of the alphabet. It was &lsquo;Calvin,&rsquo;
which I kept to myself, since it seemed to be meant to be
for myself alone; but as Leah was inquisitive, she repeated
the request for the name, to which no response came. On
her persevering with the request, it was rapped out, &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t be pumped.&rsquo; This was just like Calvin, who, when
he had once declined to answer a question would never be
forced to do so. The cards were then called for by the
Spirit, and I was directed to put the pack under the table.
Presently it was rapped, &lsquo;Cut for deal.&rsquo; I stooped down
and cut the pack on the floor, and laid my cut alongside
of the pack. The Spirit then said, &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; and there
under the table lay his cut, on the other side of the pack.
It was better than mine, and gave him the deal. It was a
right bower. We then distinctly heard a shuffling of the
cards under the table, and the Spirit called on me to cut
them. I said to him, &lsquo;But you have the advantage over
me, as you have all the cards under there to yourself.&rsquo;
He replied, &lsquo;Yes, I can see them all, but I will play fair.&rsquo;
He then told me to put my hand under the table, and my
three cards were placed in it. I was again directed to
look, and found that he had also dealt himself three. The
other two due to each player were then dealt in the same
way. On being directed to look again under the table I
saw that his turn-up card was a jack. As the trump did
not suit my hand, I said, &lsquo;I pass.&rsquo; The Spirit took it and
discarded. I then led, by laying my card on the table.
The Spirit responded to my play by placing his card into
my hand which I held under the table to receive it. In
that hand he made a march. We thus played out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
game in four deals, which he won, making five points to
my two. I did not doubt his having played fair. I then
told Leah who my antagonist had been, and she said,
&lsquo;How like Calvin that was to answer my pertinacious interrogation
by saying that he would not be pumped.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h3>MARGARETTA&rsquo;S DREAM.</h3>

<p>One morning, when my sister Margaretta came down to
breakfast, she was looking pale, and tears were in her eyes.
She related a dream which had greatly affected her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sitting in the north room at home
(in father&rsquo;s house). The door was open. Suddenly the
sun seemed to be eclipsed: while the atmosphere was filled
with particles of dust, which at times were wafted in clouds
which nearly obscured my vision. (The road is visible
from the door for the distance of half a mile.) I observed
a form slowly approaching amid the shower of dust
and débris; and as it came nearer I recognized in it my
sister Maria, dressed in deep black, and ran to meet her.
She raised her hands, saying, &lsquo;O Maggie! isn&rsquo;t this
dreadful?&rsquo; As we met, a leaf (as from a book) dropped
at our feet. I picked up the leaf and read from it these
words:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;Leaves have their time to fall,</span>
<span class="i2">And flowers to wither at the north-wind&rsquo;s breath,</span>
<span class="i0">And stars to set&mdash;but all,</span>
<span class="i2">Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!&rdquo;</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We were all deeply impressed, and felt it to be a warning
of some sad event in the near future.</p>

<p>It was early, we had not yet breakfasted, and were sitting
together feeling very dejected, when my brother (who
lived thirty miles east of Rochester) walked into our room,
and finding us all in tears, threw his arms gently around
mother&rsquo;s neck and asked her what was the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>We told him Margaretta&rsquo;s dream, well knowing that he
must have sad tidings to relate to us, as he had ridden all
night to get there at that hour of the morning. He wept,
and sobbing aloud said: &ldquo;I am the messenger of sorrowful
tidings. Dear little Sanford Smith is dead.&rdquo; This
was sister Maria&rsquo;s little son, seven years of age. David
then told us how the darling child had passed away. He
died of croup. They did not consider him dangerously ill
at first, but hastened for the doctor. When his mother
stood over him, trying to make him more comfortable,
tears dropped from her eyes upon his precious face. He
pulled her down and kissed her, and with his little handkerchief
wiped her tears away, saying, &ldquo;Ma, don&rsquo;t cry so.
I will be your guardian spirit, and rap just so&rdquo;&mdash;making
the sounds with his darling fingers on the head-board. He
was a beautiful and interesting child: and it nearly broke
their hearts to lay him away from their earthly sight,
though conscious of his spiritual presence.</p>

<p>While Margaretta was dreaming that truly wonderful
dream, my brother David was on his way to inform us of
the child&rsquo;s death.</p>


<h3>MISTAKEN NAMES CORRECTED BY SPIRITS.</h3>

<p>Dr. A.&nbsp;D. Wilson and Dr. Kirby, both men of high
distinction, introduced to me by Dr. John F. Gray, and
who afterward became thorough Spiritualists and my dear
friends, made a bad start in their first experiences at
my circles. They both went away somewhat disgusted
with the wrong names which the Spirits of their relatives
had attributed to themselves. Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s father having
given his name as &ldquo;Patrick;&rdquo; and Dr. Kirby&rsquo;s wife having
called herself &ldquo;Mary Anne.&rdquo; They compared notes
as they went out together. Dr. Wilson said that his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
was not Patrick, but Peter; and Dr. Kirby that his wife&rsquo;s
name was Nancy.</p>

<p>Soon after Dr. Wilson came across his father&rsquo;s old diploma.
He had graduated at Edinburgh before coming to
New York, where he became a professor in (I believe)
Columbia College, and there was his name recorded at full
length as &ldquo;Patrick.&rdquo; He was not an Irishman, but a
Scotchman, and did not fancy being called &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; and
used to sign with his initial; and somehow or other Peter
got so fastened upon him that his own son never knew his
real name to have been Patrick till he found it on this old
diploma. Dr. Kirby complained to his mother-in-law that
his wife Nancy had given her name as &ldquo;Mary Anne.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, did you never know that Nancy was christened
Mary Anne?&rdquo; was her reply. The two doctors again
compared notes together to better purpose than before;
and we all had a hearty laugh when they came together
to tell us this curious and excellent test they had both happened
to receive. They were both distinguished hom&oelig;opathic
physicians, as was also their intimate friend, Dr.
Gray, by whom they had been introduced.</p>


<h3>AN UNWILLING CONVERT MADE HAPPY AND GRATEFUL.</h3>

<p>One evening (in Ludlow Place) so severe a storm was
raging, and it was so bitterly cold, that I had no fear of
any visitors coming in, and had settled myself for comfort
in the basement room, and allowed the fire in the parlor
to go out. But the bell rang, and Susie announced a party
of four or five gentlemen. They had been brought by one
of my good friends from the St. Nicholas Hotel. They
were all Southerners; and one of them, an old gentleman,
had been seduced out to go with the party to &ldquo;some place
of entertainment,&rdquo; without knowing what or where. (He
was bitterly prejudiced against Spiritualism and us.) When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
he got in and learned into what he had been entrapped, he
was very angry, and refused to pay his dollar or to go any
farther. Susie reported that he was up in the hall, and
their hack had been dismissed. I sent word to invite him
down to the warm room, unless he chose to remain out in the
cold, for which I should be sorry. He finally came down,
but sat apart in a corner of the room as distant as possible
from the group of us gathered round the table near the
fire. He was, as I afterward learned, an old man now left
alone in the world with his wealth; a large family having
been swept away from him, chiefly by yellow fever. He replied
somewhat gruffly to my invitation to him to draw up to
the fire, and my friend scratched a few lines to me telling
me to take no notice further as he was a sceptic, and very
angry at the trick they had played upon him. Before long
came some raps, saying, &ldquo;Father, do come to the table and
get warm,&rdquo; signed with the names of his wife and a number
of his children: and they happened to be rather unusual
names, of which I remember only Tabitha, Rebecca,
and Sarah. As one after another he heard them rapped
out, he turned in his seat and became evidently excited
and affected, and even tears began to stream down his
aged face. He came to the table, where he received such
satisfaction that his long-lost dead were really there and
speaking to him, that when the party broke up he expressed
great gratitude; and said that though he had refused to
pay his dollar, he insisted on my acceptance of the $20
bill which he laid on the table.</p>

<p>He afterwards wrote me a beautiful letter, from the extreme
South, telling me that he had been a materialist, with
no belief in the immortality of the soul; but that now all
life was changed for him; that he now knew that his wife
and children still lived and loved and were near to him,
and that he would soon be with them again. And he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
me such grateful blessings as were a compensation for the
hardships and suffering I had sometimes to encounter in the
course of my career of mediumship. The friend who had
done him the unwelcome service of thus entrapping him
within my doors is still living, and owns a large orange plantation
in Florida; and I have no objection to refer to him
any reader whose prejudices may require any confirmation
of the strict accuracy of this narrative of one of the pleasantest
reminiscences of my life.</p>


<h3>A SPIRIT KNOWS BETTER THAN THE POSTMASTER.</h3>

<p>One morning we received a message, by rapping, to this
effect:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Uncle John is on his way, and will be here to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was then on a visit to my sister at Consecon, Canada
West. We dearly loved Uncle John, and were delighted
at this announcement; and as we had never been deceived
by anything thus volunteered by our Spirit friends, we
made all preparations for his arrival, and told several
friends that he was coming. Morning came, but no Uncle
John. We went to the boat-landing from across the lake
(&ldquo;Hanford&rsquo;s landing,&rdquo; then about a couple of miles from
Rochester, though the city has now pretty well grown
down to it); but no one knew anything about him. We
then went to Amy Post, and told her how we had been
deceived and disappointed by the Spirits. Mrs. Post was
seriously affected by the false prophecy, or announcement,
and could not be reconciled to the situation without some
further explanation from those who had deceived us. All
we got from them was this: &ldquo;Go to the post-office and
you will find a letter which will explain.&rdquo; On doing so
we were told that there was none in our box. We (Mrs.
Post, Miss Coles, Sister Kate, and myself), after a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
talk over it, asked the Spirits why they persisted in such
falsehoods, with more questions which I cannot distinctly
remember. We received the reply (by rappings): &ldquo;Go
back and say you have just been told there <em>was</em> a letter
there. Tell them to look among the promiscuous letters,
and it will be found.&rdquo; (Spirits can emphasize by the
strength of their raps as well as we can by italics.) Of
course we did accordingly, and the clerk returned with a
large letter, asking if my name was Leah A. Fish; which,
of course, it was, with a variation in the order of Christian
names, and probably I had asked for the name of A.&nbsp;L.
Fish, perhaps omitting the full name of &ldquo;Leah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk had made a plain mistake. The Spirit had
been right.</p>

<p>The letter explained everything. Uncle had started
from Consecon, but had been overtaken at Coburg by a
subp&oelig;na to attend an important trial, in which he was the
principal witness.</p>

<p>Spirits are but disembodied men and women, and are
not much more omniscient after their disembodiment than
they had been before it. They had given their message
truly before he had been overtaken at Coburg with the
subp&oelig;na. They had followed or accompanied Uncle John,
but had no cognizance of outside circumstances which had
occurred subsequently to their announcement, and then
quitted him. There is instruction in this, as well as a
curious interest.</p>


<h3>OPENING OF A COMBINATION LOCK.</h3>

<p>Professor Mapes had a friend who knew that he was
investigating Spiritualism, and told him that he (the friend)
had a test which none of his mediums or Spirits could
meet, but that he would give the mediums $600 if they
could do so; that being a sum he had unexpectedly come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
into and would gladly give if it could be done. The Professor
brought him to me, and he pulled out his $600 and
produced a combination padlock, which he had set to a
certain word, and he offered me the $600, to which I was
welcome if I could open it. I told him that neither the
Spirits nor I would do anything for money, and I refused
to attempt it unless he put back his money into his pocket.
This he had to do, but he continued to sit in the public
circle, for which he paid the regular admission fee of one
dollar. Nothing came for him till, just as the party was
breaking up, there were rapped out the letters, <i>l-o-o-n</i>,
followed with the sentence &ldquo;Open your lock,&rdquo; which nobody
understood till some person, repeating them aloud,
said, &ldquo;That spells <em>loon</em>,&rdquo; which Mapes&rsquo;s friend heard, and,
starting up excitedly and with an oath, cried out, &ldquo;Why,
that is my word!&rdquo; The lock was at once opened at the
word. He again threw the $600 to me, saying that I was
heartily welcome to it. But he at last was compelled to
put back his money. As he bade me good-night he left in
my hand a $10 gold piece, which I could not refuse to accept
as a token of his gratitude and his feelings. He came
frequently afterwards and became a thorough and hearty
Spiritualist. Prof. Mapes, in introducing him, said he
was a whole-souled man, though a positive and rough one,
and somewhat addicted to oaths, which rather displeased
me.</p>


<h3>A VISITOR MAGNETIZED INTO A MEDIUM HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>Judge Haskell, of Leroy, a distinguished man and a
member of Congress, was one of my old Rochester converts
and earnest supporters. He used to say that we
acted on him like magnets, and magnetized him unconsciously,
so that after an evening with us he found himself
receiving raps himself, an influence upon him which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
last several days, sometimes as long as a week, and that he
used to talk freely with the Spirits in his own bed, receiving
the raps on the headboard. He evidently had in himself
the basic conditions for the mysterious gift of mediumship,
and might have gone far if he had chosen to cultivate
and develop it. Indeed, he often found himself, in his
speeches, departing widely from what he had intended to
say, and even speaking against his opinions, under an influence
controlling him against his own mind.</p>


<h3>CURIOUS STORY ABOUT A MUTILATED LIMB.</h3>

<p>I went with mother to visit my sister, Mrs. Osterhout,
who lived in Canada West, near where my father had
formerly resided. A bad accident occurred to a young
man named Charlie, whose leg was so crushed by a heavy
log rolling upon it that it had to be amputated above the
knee. As we sympathized with the family, mother and I
went over on the first night after the amputation to watch
with him and help take care of him, while supporting his
mother with our company. The limb had of course been
buried. During the night he moaned and cried incessantly,
and begged us <em>to turn his foot over</em>. We did not
understand him until he said, &ldquo;Tell Joe (the hired man)
to turn my foot over; they have buried it with the toes
downward.&rdquo; We went and told Joe about it, who made no
account of it, regarding Charlie as not in his right mind;
but the latter continued so long with the same cries which
proved such severe actual suffering, whatever might be
the illusion possessing his mind in regard to his buried
limb, that we were compelled to satisfy him by directing
Joe to reopen the hole, which could scarcely be called a
grave. It was a fact; the leg was found exactly as Charlie
had insisted it was, with the toes downward. It was accordingly
turned over in the box in which it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
buried, so as to rest in its natural position on the heel, and
poor Charlie immediately dropped to sleep, nor did he
make any further complaint. The reader has probably
heard or read of analogous stories about pain being felt in
the extremities of limbs which had been amputated; continuing
in some cases long after the amputation. The
Apostle says: &ldquo;There is a natural body and there is a
spiritual body.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>DISTURBANCES IN THE TROUP STREET COTTAGE.</h3>

<p>One Sunday night, at Rochester, in that pleasant house
on Troup Street, there was one of those tremendous snow-storms
which no longer appear to fall there as often or so
deep as they did at that time. Margaretta and I were
alone in the house. Alfie, our housekeeper, had gone out
for the day, and we had no expectation of her being able
to return through such a snow-storm. The house was built
on ground which sloped down to the rear from the front
level of the street. We were sitting in the dining-room,
which was a sort of rear addition to the cottage, and had
a veranda from which a door opened into the room, while
another door led by a few steps to the cellar in which was
a well&mdash;though we never used the water from it, as I
mistrusted its healthfulness; indeed I had a strange feeling
about that well, as though it might have been the
scene of a crime. The wind coming furiously from that
direction piled up the snow-drift all the height of the
lower sashes of the windows, and of course blocked access
to the door from without. There were often so much
knocking and other sounds about that cottage that I believed
it, like the others, to be haunted.</p>

<p>Margaretta and I were making ourselves comfortable.
We had drawn the table near to the stove, and upon it was
one of the country mince pies, such as New York does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
know, and she had just lifted the teapot when knocks of
the most fearful character thundered directly under her
feet. The blows implied a heavy mallet and a powerful
arm, which so startled her as to cause her to let fall the
teapot. Neither of us could stir from the spot. There
was no cellar under this <em>rear</em> addition to the cottage, but
the door from the cellar, which was under the main building,
opened into the tea-room very near to where I sat.
Tremendous pounding commenced against the cellar-door,
causing it to fly open and close again several times as by
the same hand. Immediately after came from outside
groans as from some one apparently perishing in the storm,
seeming to indicate extreme suffering and anguish.</p>

<p>As we huddled together and sat paralyzed, we heard the
cheerful voice of our good Quaker friend, Mr. Willets, and
a knocking at the door of a character not mysterious, and
as soon as we were able to get the door open, Mr. Willets,
a gust of wind, and no small drift of snow, entered together.
&ldquo;Well, girls, I got anxious about you, and, as Alfie is away,
my wife and I thought you might have no water and wood
for to-morrow morning, and it would be harder to get at
you then; for this snow is going to last all night.&rdquo; He
stayed a little while, when he found we were sufficiently
provided, and then this good man and friend made his
brave way out again.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Willets had left, Calvin also came to us under
the same alarm, and to cheer us with his presence, and he
stayed all night. And although there was no more moaning
outside, yet the same heavy pounding on the floor
<em>continued through the night</em>. Though we at least went to
our bed, the agitation and excitement prevented our having
anything more than a disturbed sleep; and whenever we
would awake, there were still the sounds, which lasted till
morning; and the neighbors too told us the next day how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
they had also heard and wondered at them. I have forgotten
to mention that Mr. Willets and Calvin went out
into the storm to see if they could find anybody or any
signs of anybody outside the house, but they found nothing
but the undisturbed levels of the snow.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only occasion of such violent and protracted
knockings both there and elsewhere. At my house
in Ludlow Place, New York, we sometimes could not help believing
that there were burglars in the house, and utterly reckless
in their noises. We sometimes called in the policeman
to search the house as some of our friends must remember.
For the sake of male protection, I had (their friends being
ours and ours theirs) invited Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Johnson
to occupy rooms in my third story, and to share our table
(for which we had to permit them to contribute the small
sum estimated to cover the additional cost of the latter), and
several times had Mr. Johnson come down during the
night and insisted that there must be burglars in the
house:&mdash;and this, notwithstanding all his past observations.
There were some reasons for suspicions of crime
having been committed in that house also. Now what
sort of Spirits were they who thus disturbed our nights?
And why? Of course I, many a time, interrogated them,
but never got any satisfaction from their answers. They
would never give any special motive or reason for their
thus coming, and would only say that they <em>could</em> do it, and
that they <em>would</em>.</p>

<p>They never did any mischief beyond the fright and
causing us to go up and down stairs and all over the house:
perhaps they were not allowed to do so, by other spirits,
who nevertheless had no power to prevent their coming.</p>

<p>Was it their purpose to keep us up to the task that had
been imposed on us, and in a state of submission from a
sense of our powerlessness against them? I could not answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
these questions then, nor can I now. A friend has
suggested that they were perhaps miserable and earth-bound,
and unprogressed spirits whom our mediumship
gave access to us and certain limited means of action on
material objects in our atmosphere, and they may have
found a diversion from the poor life they are as yet living,
and some amusement in frightening us, somewhat as children
enjoy the mere making of noise and startling people,
without attaining or seeking any other object. There are
plenty of people daily passing into the Spirit condition,
where they undergo no speedy change, of whom this is
very supposable.</p>

<p>A predecessor (daughter of Mr. Calhoun) in the occupation
of this house, some years before, told me that they
had heard similar noises, and Mr. Calhoun told me that he
and friends had sat up in the night with pistols to catch
the burglars presumed to cause them.</p>


<h3>A CAUTION AGAINST CRUELTY TO ORPHAN CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>In Canada West, not far from the residence of my sister
Mrs. Elizabeth Osterhout, there lived a family consisting
of a husband, wife, and three children, and a &ldquo;hired&rdquo;
girl, whom Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;favored. Mrs.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;was rapidly declining;
and she feared that her husband would marry the
girl, after her death. Knowing the violent temper of the
girl, she besought her husband not to marry her, and thus,
necessarily, place the children under her care. He promised
his wife he would not: but his promise was soon
broken, and to his sorrow he found, when too late, that
his wife&rsquo;s fears were being realized. The children were
neglected and cruelly beaten for the least offences. They
were sad, and were often seen crying and hungry. The
neighbors fed the little ones whenever an opportunity offered;
and the children told strange stories about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
mother coming to them at night. They said she came and
covered them with blankets which their step-mother would
not allow them to have on their beds; and they said that
when she found the blankets on their beds she would whip
them; and when they told her that <em>they</em> did not put them
on the bed, she would accuse them of falsehood. But she
soon had reason to know that a power beyond the children
was at work there. The step-mother had taken the feather
bed, which their own mother had made for them, and tied
and hung it up, because she said they would soil it.</p>

<p>Soon after this, quantities of feathers were lying about
the sleeping-room, which could not be accounted for; until,
on close examination, they discovered the bed-tick was
burned all over in exactly the form of human hands.</p>

<p>This could not be charged to the children; and the occurrence
was talked over by every one in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Still the children were shamefully treated, starved and
beaten for the most trifling things. There was another
child born into the family, and the elder ones were made
to take care of it, and were abused whenever it cried. One
day Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;was obliged to leave home to be gone over
night. The youngest of the first wife&rsquo;s children was suffering
with cholera infantum, and cried for want of care.
This disturbed her ladyship. She left her bed in a passion,
jerked the little sufferer out of its bed, setting it hard
on the floor, while the other two were ordered to take care
of the sick child; and as she turned to leave the room she
was met face to face by their Spirit mother, who, with open
hand and extended arm gave her a slap on the forehead.
She turned to the children saying, &ldquo;Your mother has
killed me.&rdquo; Her forehead instantly turned black where
the Spirit hands and fingers had touched her, and the
marks corresponded exactly with the forms burnt in the
bedtick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>She died three days after the hand had slapped her; and
the discolored brow was hidden in the tomb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is no fancy sketch, as some may be disposed to
imagine. It is verily true as the terrible punishment was
deserved.</p>


<h3>MRS. HOPPER&rsquo;S MYSTERIOUS END.</h3>

<p>A well-authenticated and most mysterious occurrence,
and one which has always left in the minds of the residents
of Rockland County a strong inclination to credit a belief
in witchcraft&mdash;I confess to something of the kind myself&mdash;took
place in my father&rsquo;s school-day time. I have listened
to his recital with staring eyes, ready to catch the slightest
incident connected with it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopper, a very beautiful woman, was possessed of
some very strange power. It was said that even when
quite young she would perform strange feats with children
who were in the habit of associating with her; and it
was clearly ascertained that she had been seen in different
places at one time.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> I cannot say anything of my own
knowledge of all this, but there is no doubt of the facts
which I am about to relate.</p>


<p>Mrs. Hopper had not appeared in her usual spirits for
several days. She complained of not feeling well, wished
to be left to her repose, and appeared to be looking forward
to something they could not comprehend. One of her
bridal gifts was a favorite colored boy, a lad about seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
years of age at the time of her departure. (Slavery
still existed in New York.) She was an only child and
much petted by her parents and friends.</p>

<p>Her mother, on learning she was ill, went to spend a few
days with her, in the hope of cheering her spirits and benefiting
her health. One afternoon she seemed more than usually
restless, and called to Jack (the colored boy) to bring
his hat and coat to her to repair them. While mending
his clothes, she said to Jack, &ldquo;Who will mend your clothes
and care for you when I&rsquo;m gone?&rdquo; He tried to console
her, and said, &ldquo;You aint a goin&rsquo; to die, Missus, you&rsquo;re too
young.&rdquo; She told her mother she needn&rsquo;t stay with her
as she was quite well and her mother was needed at home.
She also told her husband she would rather he would sleep
in another room and leave her alone that night. They all
complied with her wishes. The next morning her husband
found the doors ajar, and on entering the room discovered
that her bed had not been slept in, and on closer examination
discovered her comb and pins on the stove and all
her wearing apparel torn open (in front) from head to foot,
and lying on the floor just as they had been stripped from
her body. They searched the house and barn but could
not find her. They explored the neighborhood, but no
trace of her nor footprints could be found. The neighbors
turned out to hunt for the missing woman. School was
dismissed and the children joined in the search.</p>

<p>Near the place where she lived was a swamp. (My
cousin took Mr. Underhill and myself to see the house.
It is a short drive from his home&mdash;&ldquo;Mountain View
House.&rdquo;) The swamp named was quite extensive at that
time.</p>

<p>The party hunted three days; taking horns along, which
they sounded, whenever they strayed apart, to call them
together again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe it was my father&rsquo;s aunt who first discovered
the body of the missing woman (which they had traced by
her hair; some of which they found hanging in the limbs
of the trees). Her body was lying on a dry elevation, in
the swamp, in a state of entire nudity; and so surrounded
by mud and mire that they were obliged to make a log-way
to enable them to reach and remove it. My aunt removed
her apron and covered the body with it.</p>

<p>Her story is still repeated by many of the oldest inhabitants,
and to-day remains no less a mystery.</p>

<p>I believe she had covenanted with evil Spirits, and the
time or limit of her agreement was ended. &ldquo;Try the
Spirits. By their fruits ye shall know them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never yield your judgment to Spirits, however good
they may be, unless you are sure you are doing right.
Obey the small voice within, and always bear in mind that
the highest gift from God is your own good sense. So say
my guardian Spirits.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;TOUCH SAMANTHA.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>A very amusing incident occurred in one of my afternoon
séances. Mr. Decker, with his wife and sister-in-law
(acquaintances of mine from Rochester), visited me and
took seats in the circle. There were already about twenty
around the table. Mr. Decker was a believer in the manifestations
himself, but his wife&rsquo;s sister, Samantha Pierpont,
knew very little about the subject, and was afraid to sit in
the circle.</p>

<p>He urged Samantha to come to the table, which she did
after much persuasion. When it came Mr. Decker&rsquo;s turn
to ask questions he called on the Spirits to &ldquo;touch Samantha,&rdquo;
but he had scarcely uttered the words when he disappeared
from the circle and was seen coming out, feet
foremost, from under the table at the very farthest extremity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
causing a great scattering among the visitors.
Mrs. Ward fainted, and two other ladies had to be taken
out of the room. The séance was broken up for that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Dresser was one of the party, and Mrs.
Ward had accompanied him to my house.</p>

<p>This seems to have been a counter practical joke, played
upon himself by some humorous Spirit (of whom there are
many) for the one with which he was persecuting poor
Samantha.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;I FEEL MY HANDKERCHER TIED TIGHTER EVERY MINIT.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>When I first moved into Ludlow Place I met, in the
street, a colored woman with a brush and pail in her hand.
She was very pretty and jolly, and I engaged her to help
clean the house. I set her at work in the china closet, and,
before she had been ten minutes there at work, she turned
to me and said, &ldquo;What yer got in dis yer house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She muttered awhile, and in a moment more she said,
&ldquo;Well, mebby yer don&rsquo;t know, but I feels my hankercher
tied tighter every minit.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;NO BRIMSTONE YET.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It has often struck me that there was something more
than mere chance in classes of persons who would gather
round the table in my circles. There would be occasions
when <em>none</em> but persons of superior intelligence and elevation
of character would meet there, as though some kindred
influences had prompted them thus simultaneously.
When a few persons of this order began to come, I have
often said to mother, &ldquo;We are going to have good manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
this evening, as a galaxy of fine heads and noble
faces are gathering round the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley has more than once remarked upon this to
me, saying, &ldquo;Leah, I never, in any assembly, meet so many
noble heads and the same order of intelligence I meet at
your receptions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One evening there was such an assemblage of some
twenty-five or thirty persons, of whom none were misplaced
in such good company. One young Quaker lad, of
seventeen or eighteen, had accompanied his father. He was
a fine, bright and gentlemanly youth. It was the practice
that each person took his turn, as they sat, to address his
questions to the Spirits. When the right came to him to
ask his questions, he waived it in favor of his older neighbor,
who, however, declined to accept it, and insisted on his
using his privilege. Accordingly, he wrote his question,
screening his paper with a book as he did so. His first
question was, &ldquo;Is my friend John here?&rdquo; Three raps
gave the answer <em>Yes</em>. He then asked a second question
to which came the reply: &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that; I
haven&rsquo;t smelt any brimstone yet.&rdquo; This elicited a general
laugh, and he was pressed to show his question, to which
he objected, until he was overborne by his father. It
proved to have been, &ldquo;John, are you in hell?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>KITCHEN WORK BY NIGHT.</h3>

<p>We have been awakened by the most fearful sights and
sounds when no human being other than ourselves was
stirring in the house. On several occasions I could not
rest until I called a policeman in, and had the house
searched from garret to cellar.</p>

<p>The manifestations were sometimes calculated to excite
our sympathy, at other times they have lured us by false
representations. I will give an instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother and myself were in the sitting-room on the
second floor alone, quite late at night (not far from midnight),
when we distinctly heard walking, talking, and
opening and shutting of doors. I said to mother, &ldquo;Can it
be possible that the girls are in the kitchen at this late
hour?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;No, I saw them go up over an hour
ago, and Susie said good-night to me.&rdquo; I then thought I
noticed the odor of cooking from the kitchen. The girls
had a habit of sitting up late, and I determined to go down
and detect them in their tricks (on one occasion I had
found them entertaining a large party, when they had supposed
I was in bed and asleep). We started cautiously,
listening as we went, and occasionally hearing movements,
appearing to us slyly made, as if careful on their part not
to be overheard. We took no light with us, as we did not
expect to need any. The lower hall seemed lighted from
a window opening into it from the front basement, and a
bright light shone from under the kitchen door which enabled
us to see everything around. I went cautiously to
the door, opened it quickly and found utter darkness and silence.
As I opened it I distinctly heard a clatter as of griddles,
etc., dropping. Judge of our surprise when suddenly
we were instantaneously seized and hustled about, and then
both transported or lifted to the floor above by an irresistibly
powerful &ldquo;force.&rdquo; I believe that it was a device cunningly
conceived by mischievous Spirits at play, to lure us
down, and then frighten and bewilder us.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;SICH A GETTIN&rsquo; UP STAIRS.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>One evening when Margaretta and I were alone in my
private room (the front room of the second story), some
friends wanted a dark séance; for which purpose Katie
went down with them into the basement room. The parlor
floor was unoccupied, and at a late hour the servants extinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the hall light, supposing all to have gone. But
the dark séance in progress with Katie in the basement
continued so long past midnight, with no sign of its breaking
up, that I at last sent Margaretta down to let them
know the hour and put an end to it. Of course all was
dark on the two lower floors, but she could easily make
her way. But as she was about to knock at the lower
door, she was suddenly seized by some person who hurled
or shot her up, as it seemed to her, and landed her on her
feet at the head of the stairs on the second floor, where
her scream called me out from my room, and she related
what had occurred. It was evident that there were some
Spirits there who did not choose to have the séance going
on below interrupted.</p>

<p>There is an old negro melody which tells how</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;Sich a gettin&rsquo; up stairs</span>
<span class="i2">I never did see,</span>
<span class="i0">Sich a gettin&rsquo; up stairs,&rdquo; etc.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Margaretta had been pitched, as it were, in an instant, up
the two flights of stairs. The reader may refer to the
next story for a somewhat similar way of being carried up
stairs which once befell mother and myself.</p>


<h3>THE DEATH OF ISAAC T. HOPPER.</h3>

<p>Hon. John W. Edmonds met occasionally with a private
party, numbering from twelve to sixteen persons, nearly
all singers of a choir belonging to a church in this city.
This was my first private party formed after my settlement
in New York, in 1852.</p>

<p>The rules of the party were to meet at precisely eight
and close at ten o&rsquo;clock. Judge Edmonds came and went
as he pleased, often to the annoyance of the party through
the interruptions thus produced. He came in one evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
about nine o&rsquo;clock and took his seat in silence. The party
were singing their sweet anthems, and all seemed drawn
together in harmony. At the close of the singing our attention
was suddenly called to a peculiar sound in the
extreme corner of the room. Mr. Bostwick was secretary
of the circle. I have his minutes of it, which differ materially
from Judge Edmonds&rsquo; account, written from memory
by Dr. Dexter, and published in his book.</p>

<p>I here give it exactly as it occurred.</p>

<p>This singular sound signaled the alphabet, which I called,
and the following message was given to us all:</p>


<p class="r2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Friends</span>: I am free from all suffering and
anxiety. I am re-united with the beloved partner of my
youthful days.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">&ldquo;Isaac T. Hopper.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>Judge Edmonds exclaimed, &ldquo;Gracious Heavens! can this
be true? I have been with him from noon until seven
o&rsquo;clock this evening; and when I left him he seemed likely
to live a month.&rdquo; Then, taking a small pamphlet from
his pocket, he said, &ldquo;I read this to him; he listened attentively
and expressed his opinion upon it favorably.&rdquo;
He then said, &ldquo;Mrs. Brown, can&rsquo;t you send one of your
girls around to see if this is true?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No, Judge;
I could not send my girls out at this hour of night.&rdquo; The
party all cried out, &ldquo;No, Judge; go yourself. We will
await your return.&rdquo; He went, and was gone about an
hour.</p>

<p>When the door-bell rang we sat in breathless silence.
The Judge paused in the door-way a moment, then solemnly,
and with trembling lips, said, &ldquo;When I got there
he had been dead an hour.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>


<h3>WILLIAM M. THACKERAY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Thackeray during his stay in New York visited my
public séances, but never asked questions in a crowd. His
course of investigation was unlike those of all others. The
first visit he made he sat and listened to the sounds; and
when his turn came to ask questions, he politely asked me
to accept his arm and walk with him through the parlors
(fifteen minutes were allotted to each visitor) and he said,
&ldquo;You must be weary by this time. Do your investigators
always tax you as they have this evening?&rdquo; I told him I
considered this party very little trouble in comparison to
most others. The raps followed us as we walked, and
were heard by all in the room. He apparently paid little
attention to the sounds as we walked. Suddenly he stopped
in the middle of the room, and said to me: &ldquo;I have read
much of your family, and the persecution you have been
subjected to; and the various expositions of the wise ones;
but they have not been able to convict you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rappings became tremendous, and the floor trembled
beneath our feet. They were made all about the room and
on the furniture. I invited him to call during my private
hours, which he subsequently did, and conversed with the
Spirits freely.</p>

<p>When he bade me good-by for the last time, he expressed
pleasure at having met us, and thanked me for my kindness
in permitting him to visit us during our private hours.
He expressed himself delighted with his visit, and said he
was thoroughly convinced that no earthly power could
make the sounds as he had heard them: and he laughed
heartily at Dr. Flint&rsquo;s theory of the knee-joints. Though
compelled to restrain the public expression of it in the
<cite>Cornhill Magazine</cite>, of which he became editor, it is certain
that Mr. Thackeray was a full Spiritualist, even though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
one of those bolder Spirits among men who feel, and live up
to, the duty of proclaiming to the world, cost what it may,
the divine and regenerating truth which has been received
into their own souls. But great difficulties, it must be
confessed, stood in his way. The bigotries of his country
and times made it impossible for him, under the necessities
of a profession wholly dependent on the favor of public
opinion, to go further than he did, while it is certain that
he was too noble and true a man ever to cater to those
bigotries by a word of depreciation of Spiritualism.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;WITCH STORIES.&rdquo;</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Amy Emmet, a well-known character in Rockland
County, N.&nbsp;Y., was reputed a witch. And I have been
told by a perfectly reliable gentleman of many strange
things which occurred in the case of an own sister of his,
who is still living. She (his sister) would roll over the
floor, like a hoop, for a long time; and, when relieved
from such terrible control, would lie helpless and nearly
exhausted.</p>

<p>My parents and grand-parents knew her and believed
her to be possessed by evil powers.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Mary Treadway was a little girl; a playmate of my
mother. She suffered greatly under the power of some
evil influence. She would scream and say, in terror, &ldquo;See
her! See her!&mdash;Now she&rsquo;s pinching me.&rdquo; Then, apparently
for saying so, she would be stoned nearly to death.
She would be black and blue all over after being pinched,
covered with bruises, and often hit in the face with stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
tied up in rags. Her mother made a deep pasteboard sun-bonnet,
hoping that the poor child might be relieved by
wearing it; but the stones would hit her in the face just
the same, even when she would bend her face down near
the ground to avoid them. Mother saw the stones strike
her, apparently coming from the mirror. After having
been troubled in every possible way, she suddenly became
completely covered with a living mass of vermin.</p>

<p>Her parents were well-to-do, respectable, cleanly people.
Her tormentor died, and she recovered.</p>


<h3>GEORGE THOMPSON.</h3>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs. A.&nbsp;L. Underhill</span>:<br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>&mdash;Having learned that you are about to
publish a somewhat detailed account of your experience
in connection with the phenomena of Spiritualism, and
fearing that you might not remember an occurrence which
took place at your house on Troup Street, in the city of
Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y.&mdash;I think in 1849, when George Thompson
(the English abolitionist) came to this country to lecture
against slavery&mdash;I take the liberty of referring to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While lecturing in Rochester, he expressed a desire to
witness something of what he had heard so much about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kedzie and myself, with a few other friends called
on you. After being seated around a table, the rapping
indicated that many Spirits were glad to manifest to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thompson took a seat on the opposite side of the
table from you, and commenced asking questions by writing
them. A very warm friend of his, who had travelled
extensively with him in India and elsewhere, purported to
be in communication with him. Many incidents of their
travels were recalled to his memory by the Spirit. I distinctly
remember one question which Mr. Thompson asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
orally. It was this. &lsquo;What was the present which you
sent to my wife from India?&rsquo; Answer, &lsquo;A cashmere
shawl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afterward we asked Mr. Thompson if his answers
were all satisfactory? He replied promptly, &lsquo;They were
quite right, quite right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact in this case was, that the questions put, and
answers given, were not known to you or any one present,
or in the United States of America; and all the answers
given were &lsquo;quite right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will sceptics explain, satisfactorily to themselves and
others, how this is done?</p>

<h3>A CHILD&rsquo;S LETTER.</h3>

<p>Letter from a child eight years old. I insert this letter
from a darling little child partly for love of her, but
chiefly because she soon after, as I have been informed,
developed, without any instruction, into a splendid musical
medium.</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Newark, O.</span>, July 20, 1851.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Fish</span>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised to write you a letter, and I have a few
words to say to you, it is not very long; and I hope you are
well, and I send my love to you all. I think that I&rsquo;ll never
forget you. I wish that you&rsquo;ll never forget me. We are
all well and the baby has three teeth. Now you must
come back, we all want to see you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that Mr. Brown is better. You must remember
your promise to me. I have been looking anxiously for a
letter from you. I hope you will excuse me, for this is
the first letter I&rsquo;ve ever written before. Tell Maggie that
she must not forget her promise to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Fish, I love you very much. I want to say
something to you but I don&rsquo;t know what. The fields are
green, the woods are grand, and home is dear to me, but I
would give a year for one sweet month to talk with the
Spirits. O I would clap my hands for joy. Mr. Blackman
has acted the part of a coward. He has not the independence
of a man to come out and publish the truth
like a gentleman. I would have sent you one of his papers
if they had pleased me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear Fish.</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM DANIEL UNDERHILL&rsquo;S MINUTE BOOK, BEARING
DATE JUNE 5, 1862.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;While Leah and myself, with a few friends, were sitting
at the table conversing, the following communications
were spelled out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There must be some desperate struggles before the
Union army can hold the Rebellion under control. Then
many treacheries will be perpetrated through the semblance
of peace; after which many new and arbitrary enforcements
will be carried into effect, so that the difficulties
cannot be determined for some time. Rebellion is among
you everywhere, and the only curb is the law and the right
to control. Even your leading journalists are not reliable,
and their loyalty is speculative.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Red Jacket</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br /></p>


<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No more peace; no more love; no more truth; all is
gone. My spirit sorrows, my light grows dark, my hope
fails, and my form no more appears on earth among my
tribe. My feather gone, my axe dull, my arrow broke,
and my hand no more pull the string. My eyes no more
take aim. My work to do, and I no power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Great Spirit make pale-face look up where help can
come, and then we will fly through air in cars of fire, to
call the light and heat down to wake up the love, hope,
charity, and faith which have no power now, to conquer in
the war of hatred, envy, and rebellion.</p>

<h3>PRACTICAL JOKES PERFORMED AND REBUKED.</h3>

<p>Though it is my rule not to introduce trifling incidents
which were constantly occurring to us in our domestic
privacy, yet, finding them in my private papers of
1849, I will here insert the following two because it occurs
to me that it may have had a significance intended as a
lesson to me.</p>

<p>One evening, being for a wonder without callers, Maggie
and I thought we would have a little fun at mother&rsquo;s and
Cathie&rsquo;s expense. (Mother was very easily disturbed by
any unusual manifestations.) It will be seen that, though
we began it for our fun, the Spirits took it soon out of our
hands and carried it out themselves in pretty strong earnest.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Maggie went into the parlor bed-room, and I laid down
on the sofa. She took a cane and I a shell from the table
to rap with. I precautionally placed matches near me in
case of need. She rapped <em>once</em> (with the cane) upon the
ceiling, but before I could make any attempt at using my
shell the house was in an uproar. The piano was violently
sounded, the match-box rattled against the ceiling.
I called to Maggie to know if it was she who was pounding
the piano so violently. Mother cried out, &ldquo;God have
mercy on us!&rdquo; She saw a very tall man&mdash;or the form of
one&mdash;standing in the open doorway, and recognized him as
her father. Mother was so frightened that she started up,
and as she did so tore down the window-shade, which let
in the light of a bright moon. I was unceremoniously
seized upon and lifted through a circular aperture in the
ceiling (large enough to admit four small pipes, leading
from the parlor stove into a sheet-iron drum in the room
above, in which Calvin slept). (See diagram on page <a href="#Ground_Floor_of_Troup_St._house.">209</a>.)
I was there held suspended for several minutes by two
iron hands (as they seemed to me), the one felt icy cold,
and the other almost burning hot. Calvin, in bed in the
room above, lay quietly listening to the uproar, but made
no remark. I entreated him to come down to us, but he
positively refused, saying, &ldquo;No, you have raised the Devil,
and must take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This uproar continued all night, and people gathered
around the house to listen to it. We found, by experience,
that nothing we could do in our attempt at a little fun
played off on mother, would equal the performances of the
Spirits at our expense.</p>

<p>The second of these private domestic incidents, designed
perhaps for rebukes and lessons, was as follows:</p>

<p>To make this story understood, it will be necessary to
describe the situation of the old homestead. The public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
road runs north and south; and both houses face eastward.
The old house stands about two hundred yards from the
road, surrounded by trees. Father&rsquo;s house (which was
being built at the time he was living in Hydesville) stands
near the road, with ample yard room surrounding it.
When turning into the lane, there is a slight descent until
you reach a little bridge, called the &ldquo;Tell-tale Bridge,&rdquo;
over a small stream, which in wet seasons runs through
the vale; after which you gradually ascend until you reach
the level on which the main buildings stand. It is called
the Tell-tale Bridge because the hoofs and wheels always
announce the approach of visitors.</p>

<p>It was Sunday evening. A party of David&rsquo;s friends
drove over from Newark to have a séance with the Spirits.
It was decided that they should hold their meeting at
mother&rsquo;s, with the girls (Maggie and Katie). I remained
at David&rsquo;s, with Uncle John, Calvin, and the children&mdash;the
youngest being a babe ten months old. My brother
and his wife joined the party. Uncle John suggested that
some refreshments would be acceptable and help to while
away the time. By the time we got through supper it was
near twelve o&rsquo;clock, and the hired man came home belated.
The servant girl was tired, and all save myself retired for
the night. The baby fretted for its mother, and I walked
the floor with him until he fell asleep. Still there were no
signs of the adjournment of the party. I could hear the
sounds distinctly, and concluded they had entirely forgotten
to notice the time (it was then two o&rsquo;clock). So I slipped
on the hired man&rsquo;s coat and hat and ran down, to learn if
there were any intimations of the party breaking up. I did
not wish to be observed. The night was lovely, and the
moon shone brightly; and my only refuge of concealment
was a few shocks of sweet corn left standing between the
window and the fence. They could have seen me through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the window if they had looked out from the sitting-room
in which they were holding their séance. I procured
a number of small stones and practised throwing very successfully,
hitting the mark between the windows a little
distance from them. Having thus acquired confidence in
my aim, I threw one larger than the others, which went
through the window crashing the glass into fragments. A
general scream broke from all in the room. I ran down
into the hollow near the bridge, and hid in the tall, wet
grass, knowing well enough that mother would soon be
out to explore the grounds. I heard her say, &ldquo;I do not
believe that a Spirit did it. I know it was some of those
good-for-nothing, mean coon hunters; they have heard us,
and they have done this to annoy us.&rdquo; Then father said:
&ldquo;They have no business to throw stones through the windows.
If that stone had hit any one, it might have proved
a serious thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shuddered, and was thankful it was no worse. Mr.
Codding said, &ldquo;No, Mrs. Fox, I think you are mistaken.
I heard several electric explosions just before it hit the
window.&rdquo; (Those were my smaller pebbles.) Father
said, &ldquo;Do you believe a Spirit threw that stone through
the window? If it was a Spirit it was an evil one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time they were all out in the yard looking for
the culprit, and not more than twenty feet from where I
lay cowering in the long grass wet with dew. As soon as
they all re-entered the house I ran for dear life, doffed my
hat and coat, and jumped back into the bed with the baby.
I had lain there but an instant when the most terrific rumbling
explosion went through the house, shaking it to its
foundations and waking every sleeper. I have never witnessed,
before or since, such a manifestation. Uncle John
rushed to my room, saying, &ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what has
happened?&rdquo; The parties from the other house came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and related what had happened there; but I was so shocked
by the manifestation just made that I found no difficulty in
suppressing my laughter. I had been well punished for
my folly. I had not intended to carry the joke so far, and
I prayed to be forgiven. I did not dare to confess. I knew
it would not do at that time, as the public would have regarded
us as impostors, and this as a specimen of our
tricks. I suffered alone for my sin. I heard them discuss
the matter frequently. One day, full fifteen years afterward,
my brother was giving me his opinion, saying,
&ldquo;Leah, I do believe that was a mischievous Spirit that
threw the stone and smashed father&rsquo;s window.&rdquo; I looked
at him quizzically, and said, &ldquo;Yes Dave, I believe it was
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught me by the hand and said, &ldquo;You did it! you
rogue. I know you did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confessed, and we have had many a hearty laugh over
it since; but I had not ventured to confess it to the family
for fifteen years.</p>


<h3>A PROPHETIC DREAM.</h3>

<p>On pages <a href="#Page_76">76-77</a> above, in the chapter devoted to the
&ldquo;Mediumistic Vein in our Family,&rdquo; is given an account of
my aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Higgins, having seen a prophetic
vision, miscalled &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; which nearly nine years afterward
was actually enacted over her grave, which now
speaks for itself in the cemetery of Sodus, Wayne Co.,
N.&nbsp;Y. I omitted there to mention another instance in
which she &ldquo;dreamed&rdquo; of a strange event, some weeks in
advance of its actual occurrence. I was a child at the
time, but perfectly remember it, besides its having often
been talked about in the family.</p>

<p>When the family migrated from the city of New York
to Sodus, Wayne County, N.&nbsp;Y., it had been intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
go by the canal. Grandfather had preceded the removal
of the family by about a year. One morning Aunt Bessie
(afterward Mrs. Higgins) announced that, &ldquo;We shall not
make our journey by water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked her
mother. &ldquo;Because I dreamed last night that we travelled
by land, and there was a strange lady with us. In
my dream, too, we came to Mott&rsquo;s tavern in the Beech
Woods, and they could not admit us because Mrs. Mott
lay dying in the house. I know it will come true.&rdquo; She
always felt that certainty in regard to <em>certain</em> dreams.
&ldquo;Very unlikely indeed,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;for but a year
ago, when you stopped there, Mr. Mott&rsquo;s wife lay dead in
the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;You will see.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then he must have married
again, and he will lose his second wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every particular came to pass as she had predicted. Mrs.
Johnson, a stranger to the family at that time, accompanied
them. By a change of plan they made the journey by land,
as by that means (by grandfather&rsquo;s orders) they took the
horses (three teams) to use in the new home in the &ldquo;West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they reached Mott&rsquo;s tavern, late in the evening,
they were told they could not be accommodated, as the
house was full, and Mrs. Mott was dying. Bessie said to
the clerk, &ldquo;I was here just one year ago to-day, and Mrs.
Mott lay dead in the house.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Mr. Mott was
married two months ago, and it is his second wife who is
now dying.&rdquo; It was arranged, however, for them to stay
in the adjoining house, owned by Mr. Mott and occupied
by his son.</p>

<p>Referring back (see page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>) to my great-grandmother&rsquo;s
visions of phantom funerals (sometimes more than a year
in advance of their actual occurrence), I desire to add that
such <em>pre-visioned</em> funerals were not of persons whose age
and state of health might have suggested such anticipation,
but that they were of persons of all ages, and on two occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
the deaths were by accident, namely, by drowning
and by a fall from a house.</p>

<p>In the case of Mr. Urie (page <a href="#Page_82">82</a>), the runaway that
caused his death was not that of a single horse, but of a
high-spirited span of horses. The mistake was an accidental
one made by a copyist.</p>

<p>I may add, generally, in regard to many of the strange
occurrences related in this volume, there are witnesses still
living who can attest the correctness of my statements.</p>


<h3>JAMES A. GARFIELD.</h3>

<p>One of the most pleasant of my reminiscences of our
Ohio campaign, about three and thirty years ago, is my intercourse
with the great and good man whose honored name
heads this paragraph. He was a frequent visitor to my
séances, to which he used to bring also members of his
family and friends. He combined, with his eminent intelligence,
culture and love of the truth, great geniality of
temperament and manners. He was a convinced and warm
Spiritualist, and his autograph name is a frequent one in
my register.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a few also of the representatives of foreign countries
visited us at Washington and New York, and were surprised
to receive communications in their several languages.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>To the above array of the Author&rsquo;s &ldquo;Miscellaneous Incidents&rdquo;
I will add one of recent occurrence, for the sake of
the evidence which it involves of two points, namely,</p>

<p>First, of the reality of Mrs. Underhill&rsquo;s still continued
mediumship;</p>

<p>And secondly, of the interest really taken by her controlling
Spirits in this work of hers.</p>

<p>In the course of our united labors over it, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
through a period exceeding four months, there have arisen
a number of occasions on which we have differed over various
points of expediency in regard to the arrangement and
treatment, the insertion or suppression, of her voluminous
materials or notes, and have discussed them freely, with
some tenacity of opinion on both sides, while with reasonable
candor and openness to conviction, certainly on her
side. She has generally maintained that her Spirits had
&ldquo;impressed&rdquo; and directed her so and so (the chief of them
seeming to be Dr. Franklin and her grandfather), and a
Spirit claiming to be Dr. Franklin has sometimes intervened
in these discussions, either voluntarily or on being
appealed to by us. I will describe one of these occasions,
to afford the reader the opportunity of judging for himself
of the genuineness of this Spirit intervention in these
friendly discussions between two mortals still in the flesh,
both of them actuated by an equal sincerity of zeal for the
truth and for the good of humanity.</p>

<p>We were sitting in her library, on the opposite sides of a
library table. The only other person present was a most
highly estimable friend of hers, lending her his friendly
aid in copying, who was seated some seven or eight feet
off. Both of her hands were on the table. My knee was
suddenly grasped by a strong, firm hand, evidently to call
my attention. &ldquo;Is this you, dear Dr. Franklin?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply given by three pressures of the hand
which held my knee strongly between its thumb and fingers.
I did not doubt the Spirit to be what he claimed to
be, and I asked his opinion on the point in question. He
usually addressed me as &ldquo;my son&rdquo; or &ldquo;my dear son.&rdquo; He
did not habitually seem to impose his will, but rather to
give his opinion, which I must say was generally on the
lady&rsquo;s side, and to which I generally conformed, even when
saying that I still thought differently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently I felt my knee again grasped in the same way,
but this time by what was evidently a smaller and a female
hand. It proved to be that of my &ldquo;sister Mary,&rdquo; of whose
existence Mrs. Underhill knew nothing. Her object was to
tell me to write to another sister, Adelaide (still in the flesh,
and at some three thousand miles of distance) because, as she
said, the latter was &ldquo;distressed and suffering&rdquo; on account of
my recent silence (for which there had been special reasons
causing procrastination). Of these private family names
and matters, Mrs. U. had no means of knowing anything.
Her hands, I repeat, were on the table, and there was no
human agency through which, in either of the two instances,
the grasping of my knee could have been caused.
The knowledge of my private family matters goes far to
prove that in the one case it must have been really done
by my sister (a Spirit), and this identification of her in the
one case goes far to confirm that of the other as Dr. Franklin,
both having in the same way declared who they were.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ACTION OF SPIRITS THROUGH THE MEDIUMSHIP OF A
FIVE-MONTH&rsquo;S-OLD INFANT.</span></h2>

<p class="sbt2">Various Manifestations around the Baby&mdash;Writing in Greek
through his Hand.</p>


<p>In the preceding Chapter VI., I have mentioned some
marvels about the infant mediumship of my little nephew,
the elder of Cathie&rsquo;s two boys, Ferdinand Diedrich Loewenstein
Jencken. Since the writing of that chapter and
its consignment to unchangeable type, I have come across
a copy of a newspaper which had got mislaid and was supposed
lost, the London <cite>Medium and Daybreak</cite>, of May 8,
1874. The possibility of such things as were mentioned
on my pages <a href="#Page_89">89</a> to 95 having been done through the dear
little fingers of a babe in arms, must have been hard to
many readers to believe or to realize; though it ought not
to be so difficult to those who pause to reflect that it was
not those five-months-old fingers that thus acted, but the
force and the will of Spirit powers controlling and guiding
them. For the double purpose of supporting what I have
written and of carrying still farther the marvellousness of
this perfectly attested case, I now quote from page 290 of
the <cite>Medium and Daybreak</cite> the following article, which, on
its face, bears the direct testimony of Mr. Jencken himself
and of J. Wason, Esq., a respectable English solicitor.
Of Mr. Jencken&rsquo;s unimpeachable authority enough has
been said on page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.</p>

<p><i>From the London Medium and Daybreak, May 8, 1874,
p. 290:</i></p>


<h3>MEDIUMSHIP OF A BABY.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;A brief account, for which we are indebted to Mrs.
and Mr. Jencken, of the progress of their infant boy, may
not be uninteresting to the Spiritualistic public. We hence
render it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsissima verba</i>, as received by us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby medium, whose writing we have had engraved,
was born on September 19, 1873. Of a sensitive
and delicate organization, great difficulty was felt in preventing
the life-cord snapping during the first few weeks
of his existence. Care and a good nurse, however, saved
the little fellow, who is now a healthy, blue-eyed baby,
with a singularly well-formed head and large forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six weeks after his advent, the wet nurse complained
of constant noises, resembling gentle knocks or taps. These
were at first ascribed to rats or mice; finally, the truth
could not be resisted, and the gentle rappings on the doors
of the wardrobe, on the iron head-rail of the bedstead,
were admitted to be by unseen beings. On the 16th of
November last, Mr. Jencken, desirous of testing the fact
of the medial powers of his boy, obtained distinct raps and
messages, holding his little boy near to a small round pedestal
table. Soon afterward the alarmed nurse related
how luminous hands had been seen by her making passes
over the baby; the rappings increasing in intensity;
shadowy forms had likewise been seen moving from the
hearth to the bed. A whistling sound then attracted attention;
whispered words and other mysterious manifestations
were observed. On one occasion, during the absence
of Mrs. Jencken, a Spirit-form opened the door of the
nursery, entered, and left the room all but immediately,
quietly gazing at the little boy with luminous eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the month of December, small articles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
frequently taken from the nurse; on one occasion a shadowy
form appeared bending over the bed on which the nurse
and baby were lying. Terribly frightened, the nurse
grasped the child to leave the room; soft echoes, however,
warned her not to fear. On December 16th, shortly after
Mrs. Jencken arrived at Brighton, the little fellow uttered
his first spoken words&mdash;&lsquo;Ma-ma, darling ma-ma&rsquo;&mdash;much
to the alarm of the nurse. On February 2d, the little
fellow was carried by a Spirit-form from the nursery, on
the same landing, to the door of the drawing-room, where
Mrs. Jencken, who had been impressed to go to the door,
received him into her arms.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A half-suppressed cry of
anguish from her informed Mr. J. Wason and Mr. Jencken
what had happened. On entering the bed-room the nurse
was found asleep on the bed. During the whole of this
time the rappings continued. On one occasion a halo of
light was observed to surround the baby&rsquo;s head, finally
enveloping his whole form. On other occasions clear
luminous rays of light were noticed to stream from the eyes
of the baby. On March 6th, he wrote for the first time.
This was done in the presence of Mr. Wason, whose account
is now published. A few days subsequently, two
sentences were written by the baby medium, under the
following circumstances: Mr. and Mrs. Jencken were
seated at the dinner-table, the nurse with the baby occupying
an armchair some eight or ten feet off. Suddenly a
pencil was seen between the fingers of his hand. &lsquo;Ah, he
is going to write,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Jencken, and placed a
sheet of paper on the nurse&rsquo;s knee; his little tiny hand
then moved rapidly, and wrote the words:</p>

<p class="boy">&ldquo;&lsquo;I love this little boy, God bless<br />
his Mamma.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;T.<br />
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;&lsquo;I am happy.&rsquo;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly afterward the pencil was again placed in his hand
by an invisible agency, a sheet of paper fluttered through
the room and settled on the nurse&rsquo;s knee; the little fellow
then wrote:</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;&lsquo;I love my Grandmamma,&rsquo;</p>

<p>signing the paper with a mark the late Dr. Jencken used
to employ when on earth. The paper and pencil were then
jerked into the middle of the room. Since then, owing to
Mr. Jencken&rsquo;s strong objection to any tests being applied,
no further writings have been obtained. The rappings,
however, continue, so also that strange luminosity of the
eyes, so intense at times as to alarm his mother and nurse.
Numerous letters have been received by Mr. Jencken from
different parts of England, Holland, Russia, and other
places, asking him to test this marvellous power of his little
boy, who, not six months old, has written messages; but
to all these applications the answer has been a polite refusal,
the medical gentleman attendant having warned the
parents against any trial of strength of this singularly
gifted child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In conclusion we may repeat the prophecy respecting
this boy, which prediction was spelt out at the house of
Mr. H.&nbsp;P. Townsend, New York, some five years ago, the
message received then being to this effect: that Kate Fox
would go to Europe, marry, give birth to a child, whose
medial powers would be unexcelled; so great indeed would
they be, that compared to her child the mother would be
a mere cipher. Jocosely, for years afterward, Kate Fox
was called the cipher in the house of Mr. Townsend. Thus
far this prediction has been verified. If this little fellow
be allowed by Providence to attain to years of maturity,
he may perhaps verify all that the Spiritual beings, who
foretold his birth within ten hours of its occurrence, have
foreshadowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Burns:&mdash;The sentence signed &lsquo;Susan,&rsquo; photographed
[and now reproduced in our engraving.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.
M.</span>], was written through the hand of the infant boy, aged
five months and fifteen days, of Mr. and Mrs. Jencken,
on March 6th last, at No. 5 Lansdowne Terrace East,
Brighton, by invisible agency, in my presence and that of
Mrs. Jencken and her nurse, the pencil having been placed
in the baby&rsquo;s right hand by invisible agency, when I caused
a memorandum of the fact to be written at once as a record,
and afterward had the writing by the baby&rsquo;s hand and the
memorandum with the signatures of the witnesses photographed,
and I send you a copy of the whole, which you
are at liberty to publish in the <cite>Medium</cite>, together with this
letter, if you think fit. The circumstances under which
the photographed document was written are as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Jencken and the child were taken from
London to Brighton for the benefit of Mrs. Jencken&rsquo;s and
the baby&rsquo;s health, and they had been, on March 6th before
mentioned, at Brighton over three months; and I was at
this time their guest, or rather sharing their lodgings with
them. Mrs. Jencken&rsquo;s and the baby&rsquo;s health improved,
but Mr. Jencken became seriously ill at Brighton; violent
nervous headaches with neuralgia and a general derangement
of the stomach and digestive organs. I told him I
thought his travelling from his chambers in the Temple to
the lodgings in Brighton&mdash;105 miles daily, which, by calculation,
showed he had travelled over 8,000 miles while
at Brighton within four months&mdash;was the probable cause
of his illness; but he took a different view, and consulted
his friend, a German physician of note, who agreed with
him that these rapid journeys daily were not the cause of
his ill-health. I contended that a German M.D., however
able, had no experience as to the effect on health of daily
long journeys by cab, omnibus, and railway, but I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
make no change in Mr. Jencken&rsquo;s view. On the day in
question, viz., March 6th last, baby&rsquo;s nurse was holding
baby on her lap in the parlor, by the fire, about 1.30 <span class="lower">P.M.</span>
I was writing at a table near. Mrs. Jencken was in a room
adjoining and opening into the parlor, the door between
being half open. Suddenly the nurse exclaimed, &lsquo;Baby
has a pencil in his hand!&rsquo; She did not say that the pencil
had been put into the baby&rsquo;s hand by invisible agency, and
I having had experience of babies clutching my finger
pretty tightly, took no notice, but continued my writing.
Nurse almost immediately after exclaimed, &lsquo;Baby is writing!&rsquo;
in a still more excited voice, which drew Mrs. Jencken&rsquo;s
attention, and she rushed into the parlor to the
nurse and baby, and this roused me, when I got up and
walked to the nurse, and looking over Mrs. Jencken&rsquo;s
shoulder, I saw the pencil in the child&rsquo;s hand and the
paper under it with the writing as photographed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may add that &lsquo;Susan&rsquo; was the name of my departed
wife, who was remarkably fond of children, and her Spirit
(as is believed) had on several occasions previously manifested
itself by writing and by raps through Mrs. Jencken,
who, before her marriage, as most of your readers are
aware, was the celebrated American medium, through
whose family at Rochester, U.&nbsp;S., the truths of Spiritualism
(now so stupendous) were first manifested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The value will now be seen of the advice given by
&lsquo;Susan&rsquo; to Mr. Jencken, &lsquo;to go back to London,&rsquo; which Mr.
Jencken did, and almost immediately recovered his usual
health and strength, which are those of a strong, healthy man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoping your readers may take the same interest in
this anecdote that you do, and that it may conduce to increase
the interest felt in Spiritualism, believe me, sincerely
yours,</p>

<h3>SPIRIT WRITING.</h3>

<p class="sbt1">&ldquo;<i>Photograph of a Sentence written in Greek characters by
Direct Spirit-Agency, without the Intervention of a Human
Hand, at H.&nbsp;D. Jencken, Esq.&rsquo;s, Rooms in Brighton,
February 28, 1874.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Paper (marked by a sceptic with his initials) and a
pencil were placed on the table, all the circle (one sceptic
and five Spiritualists) joining hands; lights extinguished,
a scratching noise, as of a pencil writing on paper, was
heard. On the candles being relighted, the sentence, as
photographed below from the original writing, was found
written on the initialed paper. Time occupied, about five
minutes. Present&mdash;One sceptic, Mr. and Mrs. Jencken,
Mr. James Wason (of Liverpool), and two other parties of
respectability, who were for Spiritualism &lsquo;when in her silver
slippers and walking abroad with applause, but not
when in rags and tatters;&rsquo; they did not wish their names
to appear.</p>

<p>Think of this child, born on September 19, 1873, writing
a Greek quotation from the New Testament, and in
the Greek characters, on February 28, 1874, at the age of
five months and nine days! But it was not the mere baby
fingers that wielded the pencil, though they were made to
hold it.</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> It is generally known that the &ldquo;inspirational speaker,&rdquo; Mrs. Nellie
J.&nbsp;T. Brigham, has for several years conducted, at Republican Hall,
West 33d Street, the religious services of the &ldquo;First Association of
Spiritualists&rdquo; of New York, on Sunday mornings and evenings, with an
improvised eloquence of extraordinary sweetness, strength, and holiness.
The custom is this: After a prayer, etc., she improvises responses to
questions or topics proposed by the audience, and also poems on subjects
suggested by them on the spot. In the evening she improvises
a single consecutive discourse, or what may be called a sermon, on some
subject prompted to her by her Spirit guides. The practice in the
morning is that as many of the promiscuous audience as choose deposit
on the desk their questions, tending usually to the elucidation of topics
more or less connected with Spiritualism. She has possessed and exercised
this Spiritual gift since very early childhood. A few weeks ago,
among the subjects for poems thus laid on her table was a copy of the
title-page of this volume. Her improvisation in regard to it was the above
poem, introduced by the following prefatory remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have with us this morning a lady, a Medium, who has been
known for years among the Spiritualists as one who has sown the seed
in the early forming of our faith, and scattered it with open heart and
hand. This lady, well known to you as Mrs. Underhill, Leah Fox, has
written a book, to be called &lsquo;The Missing Link in Modern Spiritualism,&rsquo;
which you will soon have an opportunity of reading for yourselves.
The dedication of it is most beautiful, as follows: &lsquo;To my husband,
Daniel Underhill, who, before I had other claims than those of the
Truth and the Right, when other friends wavered, nobly sustained me,
this narrative is dedicated, gratefully and lovingly.&rsquo; This is an expression
of just appreciation. It is the soul of the Worker, and the soul of
Justice, and the soul of a Wife. Nothing is needed to be added to it,
but this is suggested as a subject for a poem.&rdquo; She then proceeded to
deliver it.</p>

<p>Two other subjects having been also suggested at the same time, she
responded to them as follows:</p>


<h3>&ldquo;THE ORIGIN OF THE SOUL.</h3>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A drop from the infinite ocean, a ray from the infinite light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One thought from the God eternal, one impulse of his love and might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held by the love of the Father in His circling arm&rsquo;s embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One grain of sand on the wide-spread land, is a soul in this human race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It cannot fall from his being, it never can die from sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For His soul is ever in it, and eternity is His light.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>&ldquo;THE BENEFICENCE OF SUFFERING.</h3>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;No pain can be in vain, no loss an endless cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every earthly grief shall come a sure relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every leaden sorrow the jewel of to-morrow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the ranks of Mediumship there are no small number of noble men
and women possessing this splendid power. They are called Inspirational
or Trance Speakers. They speak as the mouth-pieces of Spirit
guides, using not the singular pronoun, but the collective &ldquo;We.&rdquo; The
only two whom I happen to know are Mrs. Brigham and Mrs. Emma
Hardinge Britten. One of the most competent of judges has said of
Mrs. Britten: &ldquo;No living orator could improvise, on half a dozen different
high and deep subjects, in style to compare with her. I have
heard most of the great orators of our times, pulpit, forensic, and parliamentary,
and she is the most eloquent man of them all.&rdquo; She and
Mrs. Brigham have been well called &ldquo;the Eagle and the Dove.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>FINALE.</h2>


<p>This volume has lengthened itself out much beyond the
author&rsquo;s intention, and it is more than time to close it with
the word which, in human life, is rarely uttered without
some tone of pain in the trembling voice. It is only as I
write it that I myself realize all there has been of nearness
and of feeling, constituting a link of personal relation and
sympathy between writer and reader; at least on her
humble side. It seems as though, throughout the double
process, reciprocal in its nature, we have come, by a sort of
Spiritual communion, to know each other as friends&mdash;speaking
for myself, I had almost said of loving friends.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;finale&rdquo; is a less melancholy word to the Spiritualist
than it is to those who are less penetrated with his
knowledge that what men mistakenly shrink from as
&ldquo;death&rdquo; is but the beginning of higher and happier life,
developed in re-birth, like that which gives its bright wings
to what was the creeping worm.</p>

<p>And now, in thus gratefully taking leave of the readers
who may have accompanied me, hand in hand, through
pages of which every one has proceeded from my very
heart and soul, I think I may also ask them to accompany
me one single step further, in the following, which was once,
letter by letter, dictated through me by Spirits at a circle
in New York.</p>

<p>I give it now as copied from the By-Laws of Circle
No. 1.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>


<h3>PRAYER.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, who hast created
us in thy wisdom, and sustained us by thy love, look down
with compassion upon thy children here assembled, and
assist us, we beseech thee, in our search after Thy truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roll from our minds the clouds of error, ignorance,
and superstition, that the light of Thy wisdom may shine
upon us, cheering our hearts, enlightening our understandings,
and rendering bright our pathway to Thy holy mansions,
eternal in the heavens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suffer Thy holy Spirits to minister unto us, as our
guardians and guides, to lead us from darkness to light,
and place us on the plane of everlasting progression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive far from us the darkness of our own errors and
the mischiefs of our evil imaginings, and endue us with
wisdom to receive and to know Thy truth. Teach us to
seek knowledge with a single eye to our advancement and
Thy glory, and defend us from all false doctrine. Enable
us to know and to feel Thy love, and that, through Thy
ministering Spirits, it is shielding us by day and watching
over us by night, so that when we take our departure from
this sphere, we may realize that the love of the Lord is
the feast of the soul.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p class="tn">Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</p>


<p>The text in the two pages of sheet music, one for organ and one for
piano, has been added to the rest of the song on the following page, for
the convenience of readers who cannot see the illustrations. Also,
transcriptions of the hand-written letters have been added.</p>

<p>Clicking on the image of a handwritten page will lead to an image
in higher resolution. Clicking or pointing on the Greek sentence will
show the transliteration.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved slightly for reader convenience.
Footnotes have been moved to the end of the chapters.</p>

<p>Anomalies and inconsistencies in the original have been preserved, for
instance: the name of one of the Fox Sisters, Catherine, was spelled in
many different ways: Cathie, Kate, Katy, etc.</p>

<p>Errors in punctuation were silently corrected. Also the following
corrections were made, on page<br />
69 &ldquo;preivous&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;previous&rdquo; (except by previous
